        # 3 Bit Colors

        Each pixel is a square on a screen that emits light. Each pixel can have a certain number of bits assigned to it, and bits per pixel determine the colors that can be rendered.

        In this tool we're using 3 bits to define the one large black pixel. The first bit affects the red tint. The second bit affects the green tint. The third bit affects the blue tint.

        # Do This

        -   Click the "Run" button to start the widget
        -   Click on the light bulbs to turn on or off each color and see what happens to your pixel
        -   See how many different colors you can create with just three bits
        -   Write down the binary associated with each color you come up with
      CSD U1 - PixFilter Filter Intro: |-
        # Filtering Pixels

        If you've ever used Instagram you've probably encountered an image filter. Image filters read in each pixel, process it in some way, and the return the filtered pixel. In this tool we're going to start by filtering just a single pixel before moving on to a full image.

        # Do This

        -   Try changing the color drop downs in the Filter section
        -   Click on the top row of lightbulbs in the Diagram section to see how the filter will convert the input (top bulbs) to the output (bottom bulbs)
        -   Look at how the numbers in the Binary section reflect changes to the colors
        -   Based on how the bits change, can you formulate what replace is doing? Talk to your partner and see if you can figure it out.
        -   Complete the Level 2 table in your Activity Guide

        # Combining Filters

        Now that you've played with filtering a single color channel, it's time to see what happens if we filter more than one color.

        # Do This

        -   Using the color dropdowns in the filter section, build a filter that changes the value of more than one color channel
        -   Click on the top row of lightbulbs in the Diagram section to see how the filter will convert the input (top bulbs) to the output (bottom bulbs)

        # Combining Filters

        Sometimes you'll need to filter more than one pixel to get the color change that you want.

        # Do This

        Check out Mario, he's lookin' pretty good in his red hat and overalls. Your job it to set up the filter so he looks like Luigi, with a green hat and overalls.

        -   First, determine which bit(s) needs to change in order to the change you want
        -   Once you've figured out which bit needs changing, set the filter dropdown appropriately
        -   After you've got the filter working so that, try to come up with other filters that change _only_ his hat and overalls - how many different clothing colors can you come up with?

        # Filtering Images

        Now that we've seen how a single pixel can be filtered to change its color, let's try applying a filter to an image made of multiple pixels. The filter you create will be applied to each pixel in the image - and you still have the light bulbs available to experiment with how your filter will work with individual colors.

        # Do This

        Here's a picture of a red mushroom - you're going to try and turn it into a yellow mushroom.

        -   First, determine which bit needs to change in order to turn red into yellow
        -   Once you've figured out which bit needs changing, use the filter dropdowns to make all of the red areas turn yellow
        -   After you've got the filter working so that the red has turned yellow, see if you can come up with filters that turn the mushroom other colors

        # UnFiltering

        Bit filters can be used to _undo_ filtering as well. Here's an image of a bird that's been filtered from it's original colors. Can you get it back to normal?

        # Do This

        <img src="https://images.code.org/c15636bda16e8792c59ac955332e37a5-image-1471372091393.22.56.png" style="float:right; width: 200px"/>
        Here's what our bird should look like. Use the filter to get him back to normal.

        -   Decide which colors (and so which bits) you need to change. You might need to write your thoughts with pencil and paper.
        -   Once you know which bits need changing, set the filter dropdown appropriately to test your answer
        -   After you've fixed the image, write down both your process and your final filter in the Level 6 section of your Activity Guide

        Computer code is written by humans, and all humans make mistakes. Part of being a good computer scientist is finding your mistakes and fixing them. In computer science we call mistakes **bugs**. The process of finding and fixing those bugs is called **debugging**.  Over the next couple levels you are going to work on your debugging skills.

        <summary><strong>What is whitespace?</strong>
        </summary>

        Whitespace refers to any character that shows up as a blank space on the screen, such as a space, a tab, or a new line. Whitespace helps separate different parts of the document to make it easier to read.  For example, in HTML code new elements are usually put on a new line, even though it doesn't make any difference in how the page is displayed.

        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is indentation?</strong>
        </summary>

        Indentation is the placement of text farther to the right, or left, to separate it from surrounding text.  Indentation helps to convey the program's structure.  In HTML, elements that are inside other elements are usually indented.  Here is an example:

        <pre>
           &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is inside the "body" element.&lt;/p&gt;

        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is formatting?</strong>
        </summary>

        Formatting is arranging text in a way that makes it easier to understand.  HTML is usually formatted using indentation.  That means that elements that are inside other elements are further to the right in code.  Here is an example:

        <pre>
           &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is inside the "body" element.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, in HTML code new elements are usually put on a new line, even though it doesn't make any difference in how the page is displayed.

        ::: details [**What is indentation?**]
        Indentation is the placement of text farther to the right, or left, to separate it from surrounding text.  Indentation helps to convey the program's structure.  In HTML, elements that are inside other elements are usually indented.  Here is an example:

               <body>
                  <p>This paragraph is inside the "body" element.</p>
               </body>

        :::

        ::: details [**What is formatting?**]
        Formatting is arranging text in a way that makes it easier to understand.  HTML is usually formatted using indentation.  That means that elements that are inside other elements are further to the right in code.  Here is an example:

               <body>
                  <p>This paragraph is inside the "body" element.</p>
               </body>

        ::: details [**Why does the inspector sometimes stop working?**]

        Sometimes there are so many bugs in the HTML that the inspector cannot read the code properly and it stops working completely, even on the parts of the code that are correct.  Once the bugs are corrected, the inspector will work again.

        The way that you write your code can make it easier or harder to find bugs.  If you use **whitespace** and **indentation**, it will make it easier to read and easier to fix.

        # Do This

        -   Look at the code with your partner and discuss how you should format the code to make it easier to read.
        -   Make the code easier to read by adding new lines and indentation.
        -   Fix all the bugs so that your page matches the target page below.

        have the `alt` attribute which describe the image. This is important in case
        the image doesn’t load or for people who have trouble with their eyesight.
        <br><br>\n\nAn `<img>` tag is an example of a  **self-closing tag** because
        it starts and closes in one tag.\n:::\n\n::: details [**Why does an image
        tag not have a closing tag?**]\nAn image tag doesn't need a closing tag because
        there is no text content which must be wrapped in tags. The content that shows
        on the screen is specified through the tags attributes.\n:::\n\n::: details
        [**What is an attribute?**]\n\nAttributes are extra information included in
        a tag.  Attributes have names and values. The name tells what type of information
        is being provided and then the value gives the specific information for that
        tag. \n\nFor example `<img>` tags have two attributes, src and alt. src specifies
        the name of the image file and alt tells the browser in readable text what
        the image is.\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n# The Details Matter\n\nThe `src` attribute
        needs to point to the _exact_ filename of the image you want to use. That
        means you need to pay attention to spelling, capitalization, and the file
        extension. Each of the three images on this page is broken because of an improper
        `src` attribute. Using the file menu for reference, fix each of the image
        tags.\n\n_Note: Even though the images are not loading properly, our website
        is still showing descriptive text of what should be there because we used
        `alt` attributes. Cool!_"

        # RGB Colors

        All colors, whether they have names or not, can be described by the level of red, green, and blue light it takes to make them.  This is called an RGB value (short for Red-Green-Blue).  You can use the widget on your left to try out different RGB values and see what colors they make.

        -   **Click "Run" to start the widget on the left,** and use the sliders to adjust the levels of red, green, and blue light.
        -   For each of the colors below, match it to its RGB value.

        A) red: 216, green: 191, blue: 216 - rgb(216,191,216)

        <summary><strong>What is CSS?</strong></summary>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        </pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        <strong>How does the code work?</strong>

        </summary>
        For the code to work, you need to both create a winter class and add elements to the class.

        The class is created in the style sheet, with the following code.

        <pre>.winter {
          color: rgb(195,230,255);
        }</pre>

        This code creates a class called `winter` and makes everything in the class our winter blue, which has the RGB values of (195,230,255).

        The code that adds a `h5` element to the winter class is `<h5 class="winter">`.  The `class=winter` inside the opening tag adds everything inside the tag to the class.

        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>
        <strong>What rules can be added to a class rule-set?</strong>

        </summary>

        A class rule-set can have the same rules as any other type of selector.  If a rule does not apply to the content of the class (for example, using `font-size` on an element with no text), then the computer will ignore that rule, but still use the rules that work.

        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>
        <strong>Why does the selector have a period in front of it?</strong>

        </summary>
        In CSS, a period in front of a selector means that the selector is the name of a class.  If there is no period, it means that the selector is the name of an HTML tag.
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>
        <strong>Why would a web developer use classes?</strong>

        </summary>
        A web developer uses classes when some elements should be styled differently than others, even if they are the same tag.  Classes can also be used to give elements that have different tags the same style.

        <strong>How does the code work?</strong>
        </summary>
        For the code for the winter class to work, it needs to both create a winter class and add elements to the class.

        The class is created in the style sheet, with the following code.

        <pre>.winter {
          color: rgb(195,230,255);
        }</pre>

        This code creates a class called `winter` and makes everything in the class our winter blue, which has the RGB values of (195,230,255).

        The code that adds a `h5` element to the winter class is `<h5 class="winter">`.  The `class=winter` inside the opening tag adds everything inside the tag to the class.

        <summary>
        <strong>How do I create a new rule-set?</strong>
        </summary>

        You can create a new rule-set by following the pattern that the `winter` and `spring` classes used in the style sheet.

        <pre>.winter {
          color: rgb(195,230,255);
        }</pre>

        The selector name and the color values will be different, but the following pattern is always the same.

        <pre>.classname {
          property1: value1;
          property2: value2;
        }</pre>

        <summary>
        <strong>Why does the selector have a period in front of it?</strong>
        </summary>
        In CSS, a period in front of a selector means that the selector is the name of a class.  If there is no period, it means that the selector is the name of an HTML tag.

        <strong>Why would a web developer use classes?</strong>
        </summary>

        A web developer uses classes when some elements should be styled differently than others, even if they are the same tag.  Classes can also be used to give elements that have different tags the same style.

        <summary><strong>What is whitespace?</strong></summary>

        Whitespace refers to any character that shows up as a blank space on the screen, such as a space, a tab, or a new line. Whitespace helps separate different parts of the document to make it easier to read.  For example, in HTML code new elements are usually put on a new line, even though it doesn't make any difference in how the page is displayed.

        <strong>What is indentation?</strong>
        </summary>
        Indentation is the placement of text farther to the right, or left, to separate it from surrounding text.  Indentation helps to convey the program's structure.  In HTML, elements that are inside other elements are usually indented.  Here is an example:
        <pre>
           &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is inside the "body" element.&lt;/p&gt;

            body {
              background-color: lightblue;
            }

        -   `body` is the _selector_.  It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces, in this case, the body element is the entire page.
        -   `background-color: lightblue;` is the rule that makes the entire page light blue.
            -   `background-color` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the color of the background.
            -   `lightblue` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the background light blue.

        ::: details [**What colors can I use in CSS?**]

        CSS includes most common color names (red, blue, green, etc.), and many uncommon ones.  You can see a full list of CSS color names at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp" target="_new">W3Schools - HTML Color Names</a>.  You can still use colors that are not included in the named list, but you will need to use their RGB values.

        ::: details [**What if an element inside the page has a different background color from the body?**]

        You can see the answer to this question by adding a `background-color` rule to the `p` tag.  The paragraphs will have the background color in the rule for the `p` tag, and the rest of the page will follow the rule for the `body` tag.

        ::: details [**What is a style sheet?**]

        A style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.

        :::

        ::: details [**What is CSS?**]

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

            h2 {
              color: blue;
              font-family: cursive;
            }

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

You can **add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element**.  The text you want to display as the hyperlink goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags. The `<a>` element has an attribute `href` which is the location to link to.  The location of a local page is just the file path for that page. <br> <br>

        A web site should include more than one web page, and they should connect to each other.   Here's an example of a project with multiple pages that are connected by hyperlinks (the blue underlined words that take you to another page when you click on them).

        # Do This

        -   Use the inspector tool to see the code that creates the hyperlinks on the top of index.html.
        -   Discuss with your partner how you think that code works.
        -   Click on recipe.html in the files list on the left hand side.  Add a hyperlink to the top of this page that will take you back to index.html.

        <summary><strong>What is an unordered list?</strong>
        </summary>

        An unordered list is just a set of bulleted items.

        An unordered list element has the tag `<ul> </ul>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>U</strong>nordered <strong>L</strong>ist. Each item in the list is marked by a list item element `<li> </li>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>I</strong>tem.  The list item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent element, the unordered list.

        </details>

        <summary><strong>How do I make an unordered list?</strong>
        </summary>

        Making an unordered list has two steps: making the list and adding the list items.  To make the unordered list, write the unordered list tags `<ul> </ul>`.  Next, add your list items **inside** the unordered list tags.  To make each list item, use the list item tags `<li> </li>` and write the list item inside the tags.

        It can be helpful to indent your `<li> </li>` tags so it's clear they are contained in the `<ul> </ul>` tags.

        You can also use HTML to make different types of lists on your web page.  This recipe includes two different types of lists, one ordered (with numbers) and one unordered (with bullets).

        # Do This

        -   Use the inspector tool to see the code that is making the two different kinds of lists.
        -   Make sure you and your partner agree on what the different tags do.
        -   Fix the code so that the second item in each list displays correctly

        <strong>What are hyperlinks?</strong>
        </summary>

        Hyperlinks can connect to local web pages or external web pages. To add navigation to your website you will need to add hyperlinks which connect your individual web pages. You can **add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element**.  The text you want to display as the hyperlink goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags. The `<a>` element has an attribute `href` which is the location to link to.  The location of a local page is just the file path for that page. <br> <br>

        For example to link to the unique houses page you would add the following code inside your `<body>` element. <br><br>

        <pre>
        &lt;a href=”houses.html”&gt; Unique Houses &lt;/a&gt;

        # Create a Navigation Bar

        Here's your project from before.  You'll be linking the two pages by creating a **navigation bar** at the top of the page.  Websites usually have the same navigation bar across all of their pages so you can get back and forth between things on the site.  You can see an example of a navigation bar on <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/weblab/2KO4FIjN89QPeYnTG_NzLIjroaG8daOY3jRl5uHm1Co/" target="_new">this page</a>

        # Do This

        -   In your home page (index.html), add two hyperlinks at the top of the page, one to your lists page, and one to the home page.
            -   _Even though it might seem strange to link a page to itself, it's less confusing if the navigation bar is exactly the same on every page._
        -   Copy the code for the navigation bar, then add it to the top of your lists page.
        -   Test your links in the preview area by clicking on them.

        <summary><strong>What is CSS?</strong></summary>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        </pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        The punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the stylesheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.

        <strong>What is CSS?</strong>
        </summary>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        }</pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        -   Find the CSS rule-set in the style sheet that determines the style for the paragraph tag.
        -   Change the font family and choose which one you like the best.
            -   Choose from "serif", "sans-serif", "cursive", "fantasy", and "monospace"
        -   Add a font family rule for the h1 or h3 tags.

        -   `p` is the _selector_.  It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces. The `p` stands for paragraph.
        -   `font-family: cursive;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `p` tags a particular font.
            -   `font-family` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the font.

        -   Find the CSS rule-set in the style sheet that determines the styles for the h1 tag.
        -   Using the same pattern, write a new CSS rule-set that will determine the style for the h3 tag.
        -   Add code to set a different color for the h3 tags.

        <strong>How do I make a new rule-set?</strong>
        </summary>

        To make a new rule set, you'll need a selector and a list of rules.  The selector is the name of the tag you want the rules to be applied to.  The rules are a list of property and value pairs.  You'll also need to pay careful attention to the punctuation in the rule set.  Look at the code below for an example of how the code should look.  You'll need to change the specifics for your page.

        <pre>h1 {
          color: red;
        }</pre>

        -   `h1` is the _selector_.  It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces.
        -   `color: red;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `h1` tags red.
            -   `color` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the text color.

        The punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the style sheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        </pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        The punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the style sheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.

        <strong>What is CSS?</strong>
        </summary>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.
        <br/><br/>
        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        }</pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        # Text Alignment

        The `text-align` property sets the horizontal (side to side) position of the text within each line.

        -   Find the "text-align" property in the paragraph tag.
        -   Change the paragraph alignment.
            -   Choose from "left", "right", and "center"

        ::: details [**How does the code work?**]

        Here is the code that is controlling the paragraph text alignment:

            p {
              text-align: left;
            }

        -   `p` is the _selector_.  It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces. The `p` stands for paragraph.
        -   `text-align: left;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `p` tags align to the left side of the paragraph.
            -   `text-align` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the text alignment.
            -   `left` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the text align to the left side of the paragraph.

        :::

        ::: details [**Why doesn't <code>text-align: left;</code> do anything?**]

        Most properties have default values.  The default values are the styles that an element will have automatically, before you add your style sheet.  The default value for `text-align` is `left`, so it doesn't change from how it already looked.

        :::

        # Responding to a Single Click

        Earlier we learned that `keyWentDown` and `keyWentUp` can be used to respond to a keypress a single time. The blocks `mouseWentUp` and `mouseWentDown` allow you to do that for the mouse!

        # Do This

        Let's make a simple game that counts how many times you've clicked. We've already provided a variable `clicks` that you can use to track how many times the user has clicked.

        -   Add a conditional that checks if the mouse went down.
        -   Inside your conditional, add to the `clicks` variable.

        _Challenge: Can you add a sprite that responds to `mouseWentDown` as well? Add an image of your choice and increase the sprite's size each time the mouse is clicked._

        Right now your player is always facing the same direction. You can make things look a lot more realistic by switching between animations. Your player should switch between a left-facing and right-facing animation depending on which key was last pressed. Remember, you can quickly copy and edit animations inside the Animation Tab.

        # Do This

        -   Inside the Animation Tab copy the animation of your player sprite.
        -   Flip each frame of the new animation so that the sprite is facing in the opposite direction.
        -   Rename your new animation.
        -   Use the `setAnimation` command inside the `movePlayer` function so that the player changes the direction it is facing when the "left" and "right" arrows are pressed.

        -   Use an `if` statement to check whether enemy1 is off the top of the bridge by checking whether its y value is below 140. Within your if statement:
            -   use your `setEnemy1` function to reset the sprite.
            -   add 1 to the score.
        -   Use an if statement to check whether enemy1 is off the bottom of the bridge by checking whether its y value is above 260. Within your if statement:
            -   use your `setEnemy1` function to reset the sprite.
            -   add 1 to the score.
        -   Test your program for the first enemy sprite. Make sure the sprite is resetting and the score goes up.
        -   Once it is working copy and paste the code you wrote to create the same behavior for `enemy2`. You'll need to change the name of the sprite and the name of the functions you use.

        Updating only the `x` or `y` properties of a sprite can only make it move straight up and down or left and right. If you want a sprite to move on a diagonal path you'll need to update _both_ of those properties.

        This program currently makes the mouse move straight down the screen - can you update it so that it moves diagonally across the screen like the image to the right?

        # Changing Images as you Move

        Right now your conditionals only do one thing (change your sprite's x or y), but you can actually put as much code as you want inside a conditional. A common thing to do in games is to change your character's image depending on which direction they're walking.

        # Do This

        Using the provided program and images:

        -   Duplicate your chosen bug image four times.
        -   Edit each of your images to point in one of the four directions.
        -   Write code that uses `sprite.setAnimation()` to change the image on your bug sprite when different arrow keys are pressed.

        Sometimes we want to tell our program what to do if a condition is `true`, but also what to do if it's `false`. Pressing the plus button at the bottom of your conditional block will give you another section called `else`.

        # When to Provide a Fallback

        The else clause is useful as a fallback to the main condition that you're checking - that is, if you _care_ what happens when your primary condition is `false`, you should provide an else clause to take care of it.

        # Make a Prediction: User Input

        So far you've used `keyDown` as a way to let users control your programs, but that's just one of many ways to take input. In fact, just one of many ways _to detect keypresses_! Depending on how you want to react to a keypress, there are a few other blocks you might want to use.

        Read the program and predict below what will happen when you press each of the up, down, left, and right arrows.

        After making your prediction, run the code and write down or share with your neighbor your observations.

        You will **not write any code** in this program.

        -   Read the program and see if you can guess what will happen.
        -   While the program is running, press the arrow keys and observe how the screen responds.

        One of the simplest ways to take input is to just make a sprite follow the user's mouse position. **You can get the x and y location of the mouse using `World.mouseX` and `World.mouseY`.**  This follows the pattern you learned with sprite properties. `World` is the name of the object. `mouseX` and `mouseY` are the names of the properties.

        You are going to make a bee sprite follow the mouse around the game area.

        -   The bee image is already loaded in the animation tab for you.

        Change the sprite to your favorite image from the animations tab.

        -   A sprite that is set to an image has already been created for you.
        -   Run the code to see how it works.
        -   Change the input to the `setAnimation` command to change the look of the sprite.
        -   Try out all the different images.

        # Resizing with Scale

        In the _Sprites_ drawer of the toolbox, you'll see a new block called `sprite.scale`. It lets you change the size of a sprite in relation to its original size. `sprite.scale = 1` is the normal size. `sprite.scale = 0.5` makes your sprite half as big, while `sprite.scale = 2` makes it twice as big.

        # Do This

        The program should already include your newly uploaded image, but it's probably not the _perfect_ size. Use `sprite.scale` to change the size of your `kite` sprite.

        _Hint: the order of your code matters! You need to add `sprite.scale` **after** you've created the sprite, but **before** you draw the sprite with `drawSprites()`. For clarity, try to keep all of your sprite code together at the top of your program._

        -   Use the `createSprite()` block to create a new sprite. Make sure to give it a descriptive name such as **coin**.
        -   Use the `sprite.x` and `sprite.y` properties of the sprite to give it a random X and Y position between 0 and 400.
        -   In the Animation Tab there is already a coin animation. Use the `sprite.setAnimation()` block to give your sprite this animation.

        You've already learned how to make your sprite spin by using the `rotation` block.  For example, when you wanted your sprite to rotate by two degrees each time it was drawn, you put `sprite.rotation = sprite.rotation + 2` inside the draw loop.

        Now, you can use `rotationSpeed` to make your sprites rotate by a certain amount each time they are drawn. If you want your sun to rotate by two degrees each time it's drawn, you can use `sun.rotationSpeed = 2` before the draw loop, after you create your sprite.

        # Do This

        Make the sun rotate by 3 degrees each time using the `rotationSpeed` block. ( [Show me where](#triggercallout=callout1) )

        # velocityX

        One way to move sprites in Game Lab is with the counter pattern. For example `sprite1.x = sprite1.x + 1` moves a sprite by 1 pixel each frame of the draw loop. This pattern is so common that sprites have a `velocityX` property that does this for you.

        # Do This

        -   Drag a `sprite.velocityX` block directly below where your sprite is created.       ( [Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered) )
        -   Write the name of your sprite in the block.
        -   Assign the `velocityX` property a value of 1.

        The code below uses the sprites' x and y positions to check whether they are touching.  It will change the balloon sprite's animation when the tack touches it.  Use the arrow keys to move the tack until it touches the balloon.

        # Do This

        -   You do not need to change any code on this level.
        -   Read the if statements inside the draw loop and find the different sprite properties and how they are compared.
        -   Discuss the code with your partner.  Would you want to write this code every time you checked whether sprites were touching?

        # Debug

        Sometimes sprites will behave in ways that are unexpected. There is a special `sprite.debug` property you can use to better understand why the sprites interact the way that they do.

        # Do This

        These two coins are round, so you would expect them to bounce in a certain way. Something weird is happening though!

        -   Run the code and watch the way that the coins interact.
        -   Use the `sprite.debug` block to make debug 'true' for both the sprites and run the code again.
        -   Change the gold coin's starting x position to 51 and run the code again.

        # Debugging Collisions

        The balloon is popping before the tack touches it.  When sprites aren't doing what you expect, you can use the `debug` block to get more information about why the sprites are behaving that way.  Can you find out what's wrong in the code below?

        # Do This

        -   Run the code and use the arrow keys to move the tack to pop the balloon.
        -   In the code below, change `balloon.debug = false` to `balloon.debug = true`.
        -   Add a new `debug` block to the code and set the tack sprite's debug property to `true`.

        # Applesauce

        When the apple hits the blender, the blender should turn on.

        # Do This

        Use the `isTouching` block to make the blender shake back and forth when the apple sprite touches the blender sprite.  The shaking motion is already coded using the random block, so you just have to check when the two sprites are touching.

        _Challenge: Can you make the apple disappear when it touches the blender?_

        Add an obstacle sprite to the game. You can use whatever image you like from the animation tab but the example shown here uses a sun. Right now you just need to add the sprite to your game and give it an animation.

        -   Add a new sprite to your game called "obstacle".

        So far you've been able to create simple sprite interactions by using the `sprite.isTouching()` block. For example, you've reset a coin to a different location on the screen when a character touches it. Now it's time to start making sprites have more complex interactions.

        # Do This

        -   Run the program and observe the interaction between the two sprites.
        -   Discuss with a neighbor: Using only the commands you already know how could you create this kind of interaction? There are many ways to do it, but here are some blocks to consider:
            -   `sprite.isTouching()`
            -   `sprite.velocityX`
            -   `sprite.velocityY`
            -   `sprite.x`
            -   `sprite.y`

        Be ready to share your ideas with your classmates.

        # Scoreboard

        You can also use `isTouching` to decide whether you should increase the score.  In this game, the score is stored inside the 'score' variable.  It is displayed on the screen using the `text` block.  ( [Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered) )

        # Do This

        -   Use the `if` and `isTouching` blocks to determine whether the bunny has caught the carrot. ( [Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered2) )
        -   If it has, do the following three things:
            -   Use the counter pattern on the score variable to increase the score.
            -   Reset the carrot's x position off the right-hand side of the screen.
            -   Set the carrot's y position to a random number between 10 and 390.

        # setCollider

        Sprites interact based on the size and shape of their collider, not the images that are assigned to them. You can only see the collider when debug mode is turned on.  You can change the shape of the collider using the `sprite.setCollider()` block, which lets you pick between a "rectangle" or a "circle".  By default all colliders are "rectangle".

        # Do This

        -   Find the `sprite.setCollider()` block for the gold coin, and change it from "rectangle" to "circle".
        -   Add a new `sprite.setCollider()` block for the silver coin, and choose "circle" for the shape of the collider.
        -   Run the code again to see how the sprites bounce.

        # Collision Types

        There are four types of collisions that we use in Game Lab.  These blocks will cause a certain type of interaction between the _sprite_ and its _target_.

        ## displace

        The `displace` block causes the sprite to push the target as long as they are touching each other. The sprite keeps moving normally.

        ## collide

        The `collide` block makes the sprite stop when it runs into the target.  If the target is moving, it will push the sprite with it.  The target keeps moving normally.

        ## bounce

        The `bounce` block makes the sprite and the target bounce when they touch each other.  Both the sprite and the target change how they are moving.

        ## bounceOff

        The `bounceOff` block makes the sprite bounce off the target.  The target keeps moving normally.

        -   Find a way to keep your player from going off the edges of the screen.
        -   Add a different item for your player to collect or avoid that are worth different point values.
        -   Make a variable to keep track of how many lives your player has, and then end the game when the lives run out.
        -   Add sprites that move in the background of your game.
        -   Make another background to switch to when the score gets even higher, or when the game ends.

The first background has already been created for you.  Look at the `background1` function in the code below to see how it works. ([Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered1))

        In order for the background function to do something, you have to call it inside the draw loop. ([Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered2))

        There is also an empty function named `background2`. ([Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered3))  You will need to fill that function with new code to make a different background, then test the code by calling the function inside the draw loop.

        # Do this

        -   Read the code for `background1`.
        -   Fill the `background2` function with new code for a second background.
        -   Test your `background2` function by calling it inside the draw loop.

        _Hint: It's much easier to copy, paste, and make small changes to your code in text mode._

        Making a second platform will be easier than making the first, because you can copy and paste a lot of the code, then make a few small changes.  This is a lot easier in _text mode_, so be sure to try it out if you haven't already.

        You'll need to copy two parts of your code: the part at the beginning where you made the platform, and the part in your `loopPlatforms` function, where you looped the platform back to the top of the screen.

        In Game Lab, it matters what order your code is in.  New shapes are drawn on top of the ones that came before, covering up the shapes that are drawn first.  You can see the difference when you use more than one color in your code.

        # Do This

        -   Look at the code that draws the two rectangles.  The first is drawn red, and the second is drawn blue.
        -   Change the red rectangle's color to green.

        Buttons are a great way to navigate around your app, and text labels are the primary way to display content in your app. When it comes to taking input from your users, sometimes you need a place for them to type or boxes to check. The **Text Input**, **Dropdown**, **Radio Button**, and **Checkbox** elements all provide ways for your users to input information to your app.

        # Do This

        Choose at least two of the input elements, and for each one:

        -   Drag it out and position it on the screen
        -   Change the id to something meaningful
        -   Read through the properties and experiment with them
        -   Add a label element next to each that describes what they do (don't forget to give it an id too!)

        Using your paper prototype, create a digital version of your screen using the Design Mode elements you've learned about.

        # Do This

        -   Rename the screen to match your _namespace_.
        -   Use the built-in elements to lay out your app screen, giving each a proper ID
            -   For example, if your namespace is "home\_" you might create IDs like:
                -   `home_title`
                -   `home_login_button`
                -   `home_logo`
        -   For any components of your app that can't be recreated with the built in elements you can either:
            -   Redesign to utilize built in elements
            -   Find an image to use in place of your element

        # Do This

        -   Click "Run" to see the list of answers that the classes have given.
        -   Discuss with a partner what you think the chart of this data will look like.
        -   Click "Show Chart" to see for yourself.

        Here's a widget that can calculate numbers up to to eight bits. You can use it to find the values of the two world records below.

        Don't forget to make sure that the "1" bit is always the right most bit.  If you have extra bits on the left side of the widget, just keep them turned off.

        1.  Longest tail on a dog (in inches) (5 bits)
        2.  Most spoons balanced on someone's face (5 bits)

            -   _Hint: You'll need to read the numbers in order, with the first answer using the first five bits, and the second answer using the five bits after that._

        # Bit Length

        If you don't know how many bits long each number is, you won't be able to decode a string of numbers.

        For example, the following binary string could be decoded many different ways.

This is because the number that `roll` returns can be a really big number depending on how much the accelerometer is being turned. Remember, `roll` has a range from -90 to 90.

        # Adding Some Color

        You probably noticed when you used `colorLeds[0].on()` in the last level, the LEDs turned on as white. If you don't specify a color, `on()` will turn on all three parts of the LED (red, green, and blue) to produce white. You'll see a new command in the toolbox called `colorLeds[0].color()` which lets you specify a color, either as a string like "blue" or an RGB value using color `color()` command.

It's easy to display the raw numbers coming out of a sensor, but far more interesting to present that data in different ways.

        In the earlier prediction level you saw how the `setScale()` method can convert the full range of sensor readings (0-1023) into a range that can be used for RGB values (0-255). Let's build on that idea to make an app that can communicate the current value of all three analog sensors with a single color.

        To start, we just need to set the sensor scales correctly - don't worry about actually setting the color of the background yet.

        -   Using the `sensor.setScale()` block, set each of light and sound sensors to the right scale for an RGB color channel.
        -   Create a variable for each of the three colors and assign each one to the value of a different sensor.
        -   Use `console.log()` to test that your variables are in the correct range.

        _Hint: Order matters. You need to set the scale of a sensor before checking its value_

        _Hint: Remember that the temperature sensor can be read in both Celsius and Fahrenheit - either way it should already give you a value that's within the necessary range for RGB_

        -   When might an array be more useful than a variable?
        -   Why do you always need to assign an array to a variable?
        -   How can you access the elements in your array?

        # Make Your Own Buttons

        Similar to LEDs, buttons are a really simple circuit that you can add to your board pretty easily. Like LEDs, buttons should be wired from a numbered pin to a ground pin, but unlike LEDs, a button circuit should be disconnected in the middle. When you connect the circuit, it will produce a button press event.

        # Do This

        -   Grab two wires.
        -   Connect one wire to an open numbered pin.
        -   Connect the second wire to a ground pin.
        -   Update line 2 so that it's referencing the pin you chose.
        -   Run the provided code.
        -   With the program running, touch the unconnected ends of both wires together to "press" the button.

        _Tip: A button circuit can be made with many different kinds of materials, as long as they are electrically conductive. Try making buttons with foil, silverware, or paper clips._

        # Creating Board Objects

        You might have noticed that the new blocks we're using are in a different toolbox drawer. The **Circuit** drawer contains all of the board objects that are built into the Circuit Playground, but when you start wiring your own circuits the Maker Toolkit no longer knows where everything is.

        The new **Maker** drawer contains general purpose commands instead of ones that are customized for the Circuit Playground. In addition to the `pinMode()` and `digitalWrite()` commands you've seen, it includes commands to create new objects on the board that can be programmed in the same way as the blocks in the **Circuit** drawer. The `var myLed = createLed()` command, for example, creates a new LED object that behaves just like the `led` blocks you've been using.

        # Do This

        Now that you're creating new board objects that we don't have blocks for, you'll need to work in text mode. You can still drag out blocks that you're familiar with from the **Circuit** drawer, you'll just need to change the name of the object.

        -   Keep your LED wired just as it was before (connected to pin 2)
        -   Make sure you're in text mode, not block mode.
        -   Drag out an `led.blink()` block below the comment `// Blink myLed`.
        -   Replace the text `led` with `myLed`.

        The last part of the smart bike plan that we need to figure out is the automatic headlight.

        # Do This

        First you'll need to decide what to use for your headlight. You could add another LED circuit, or perhaps you can find a way to mount the board that allows for using the color LEDs as a headlight. Once you've figured out the physical layout of your lights, add code to your program that turns on and off the headlight based on how light or dark it is.

        _Hint: If you're using the built-in color LEDs, you might need to protect the light sensor to make sure that it's responding to the ambient light level and not the light from the LEDs._

        # Looping Over Arrays

        One of the most powerful ways to use a for loop is to loop over an array, running code on each item in the array. We can do this by using the for loop counter variable (usually `i`) as the index of your array.

        # Do This

        This program should loop over the array `buttons` and do two things to each button - change the background color to red, and change the height to 50 px.

        -   Add a second `setProperty` block inside the loop
        -   Change the target to `buttons[i]`
        -   Set the "height" property to 50

      CSD U6 for loop led function: |-
        # Switching Colors with a Function

        We could write a for loop for each different color that we want to set LEDs to, but that would be a lot of duplicate code that's _almost_ the same. This is the perfect place to use a _function with a parameter_! You've seen and used functions with parameters before, but now you're going to make one from scratch.

        # Do This

        Create a function called `setLedsColor` that takes a parameter `color` and uses it to change the color of all of the LEDs

        -   At the bottom of your program, drag out a function with parameter block ![expandable](https://images.code.org/bd6ec3d9a651cf760a7dc8e1949658c0-image-1512761901850.png)
        -   Change the name from `myFunction` to `setLedsColor`
        -   Change the parameter name from `n` to `color`
        -   Inside your function, add a _for loop_ that repeats until it reaches the end of `colorLeds`
        -   Inside your _for loop_, set the color of the current led to the parameter `color` (eg. `colorLeds[i].color(color)`

        We'll add event handlers that use this function in the next level, but for now you can test your function by your program and typing this into the debug console: `setLedsColor("blue")`

        # Calling Your Function

        Now that you've created a function that can behave differently based on the parameter it is passed, we can use it in multiple different event handlers to change the lights to different colors.

        # Do This

        We'll start simple by just creating an event handler for "button\_red"

        -   Create a new event handler to respond to "button\_red"

        At this point you should have most of your program in place. Now you need to add whatever finishing touches are needed and do a little testing. When your app is ready, have your classmates try it out. See if you can find any bugs, confusing design choices, or missing features you'd like to work on.

        Add a second `onEvent` block to watch for the "stopAlarmButton" to be clicked. Inside that block:

        -   Change the status text to "OFF"
        -   Hide the "stopAlarmButton"

        _Hint: "hidden" is a boolean property. If we used `false` to make the button show up, what should you use to make it hidden again?_

        # Hidden

        Design elements have a property called "hidden" that controls whether the element should show on screen or not. We are going to use this property to create an alarm app. Notice that when the program starts one button is hidden, and one is not.

        We have already set up an event handler for the "triggerAlarmButton" which will do two things when clicked:

        -   Change the "text" property of "statusLabel" to "on"
        -   Set the "hidden" property of "stopAlarmButton" to `false` (meaning it should _not_ be hidden)

        # Do This

        -   Run the program and click "Trigger Alarm" to see how it works
        -   Add code to the provided event handler that hides the "triggerAlarmButton"

        _Note: the button "stopAlarmButton" is already on the screen, but because its "hidden" property is marked true, it isn't shown when the program starts._

        # Functions with Parameters

        Most of the existing functions you use in App Lab need inputs, or **parameters**, to pass the function necessary information. For example, when changing a screen, you pass the ID of that screen as a parameter, which looks like `setScreen("win")`.

        These parameters show up as a variable that can be used inside the function, and you can create functions that use parameters too!

        # Do This

        Click to expand

        </div>

        Instead of a separate function to move the red and the blue players, we've created one function called `movePlayer()` that takes the ID of the player image as a parameter called `player`. Inside this function, you can use `player` any place where you need to specify the ID of the player you want to control.

        -   Find where `movePlayer()` is defined ( [Show me where](#triggercallout=block_trigger) )
        -   Inside the `movePlayer()` definition:
            -   Get the current "y" property of the player and save it to a variable called `player_y`
            -   Increase the value of `player_y` by 10
            -   Set the "y" property of player to your new value `player_y`

        # Activate Your Button

        In the last lesson you focused on laying out a page of your app in Design Mode. This is a great, quick way to get the visual side of an app figured out, but it's not very functional. If you click any of the buttons you added, nothing happens. Now you're work towards adding some basic functionality by making the buttons in your app actually _do_ something!

        **Goal:** Add code using Design Mode to make the button respond to a click.

        # Do This

        Your starter app has two elements, a _label_ with the id `titleLabel` and a _button_ with the id `changeTitleButton`. To start with, you're going to make the button log a message to the console when it's clicked.

        -   In Design Mode, **click on the provided button to edit its properties**
        -   Click on the **Events** tab
        -   Insert an `onEvent` from Design Mode by clicking **Insert and show code** under the **Events Tab**.
        -   Take a look at the block that was added to the **Code Mode** tab.
        -   Run the program, click your button and **look for the output in the _Debug Console_** below the workspace instead of the app window. We will discuss the _Debug Console_ on the next level.

        # Updating IDs and Debugging with Console Log

        Here we have a couple buttons with event handlers and `console.log` statements, but they are all switched around!

        We should have given the buttons better ID names so we could tell the difference based on the ID. **Can you update the ID names and `console.log` messages to match the correct button?**

        # Do This

        -   **Change the IDs** of the buttons in Design Mode to more descriptive names.

        -   Switch to Code Mode and notice that the **ID pulldowns have been updated to include the new IDs**. (You still need to select the correct ID from the pulldown menu.)

        -   **Update the `console.log` messages** to match the buttons.

        # Switching Screens

        You can set which screen is showing in your app with the `setScreen()` command. If you're working in blocks you can select which screen you want to switch to from a dropdown.

        # Do This

        You'll use an `onEvent()` block with `setScreen()` to make the two buttons in your app switch between the two screen.

        -   Drag out two `onEvent()` blocks
        -   Set the IDs for your `onEvent()` blocks for each of your two buttons
        -   Place a `setScreen` block inside each of the `onEvent` blocks.
        -   Choose the appropriate screen from the dropdown of each `setScreen` block.
        -   Test out your app to make sure your buttons let you switch back and forth between the two screens

        # How Do Events Work?

        Event-driven apps are made up of elements that can trigger events (such as buttons) and pieces of code called **event handlers**. Event handlers are commands that "watch" for certain events to occur in your program, and then run some function when an event occurs.

        When you first create an event handler from Design Mode, puts a `console.log()` block inside to help you test the event, but you can put just about any code you want inside the event hander.

        # Do This

        The toolbox has a new block called `setText` which allows you to change the text of an element on the screen. You're going to modify the button event handler so that it changes the title text when clicked.

        -   Drag out a `setText()` block to the _inside_ of the `onEvent()` callback function (where the `console.log()` block currently is)
        -   From the block's dropdown, select "titleLabel" (the id of the element you want to change)
        -   In the block's second input, replace "text" with a new title for the app
        -   Run your program and click the button to see it work
      CSDU4 - Design Mode - 4: |-
        # IDs

        The `id` (we'll typically write **ID**) is a **unique identifier** used for each element in the app.

        Each element that appears in the app must have a **unique ID**. In fact, if you try to run a program that has two buttons with same ID you will get a warning message in the console.

        # Do This

        While each element you drag out in Design Mode gets a default ID, they aren't really that helpful (like `button1` and `button2`), so you should get in the habit of creating your own IDs.

        -   Change the ID of your "click me" button to something useful (like `redButton`)
        -   Drag out a second button
        -   Make the second button blue and give it an ID of `blueButton`

        # Icons

        Icons help users find the right functionality while also making your app feel more polished.

        # Do This

        Add a few icons to your app. For each icon:

        -   Drag out an image element
        -   Next to the "Picture" field click "Choose..."
        -   Click on the "Icons" tab and select one

      CSDU4 Connecting Screens: |-
        # Navigating

        Once you start adding multiple screens to an app, you need to make sure that users can always get where they want to go. In the next two levels you'll learn how to make sure a user can always get back to the "homepage" of your app.

        # Do This

        Here's an app with four different pages, but only the "red" screen is linked so far. In this level you'll make the other two buttons take the user to the correct screen.

        -   Add two `onEvent()` blocks, one each for the "greenButton" and "blueButton"
        -   Use the `setScreen()` block to make each button switch to the appropriate screen
        -   Test your app to make sure both buttons work. For example, when you click the green button you should go to the green screen.
      CSDU4 Connecting Screens Getting Back: |-
        # Navigating Back

        Someone using your app can now get to each of the red, green, and blue pages, but they can't get back to the homepage. You can add buttons and event handlers of your own to help them do this.

        # Do This

        Create buttons and event handlers to help a user navigate back to the "home" screen

        -   Use Design Mode to create a button inside each of the "red", "green", and "blue" screens. Make sure to give them descriptive IDs.
        -   Back in your code drag in three `onEvent()` blocks, one for each of the three buttons you made.
        -   Inside each `onEvent()` block use the `setScreen()` block that switches back to your "home" screen.
        -   Test your app. You should now be able to navigate back to the home screen from each of the other three.

        Crowdsourcing apps allow multiple users to submit content for everyone to use (the _source_ of content is the _crowd_). This app is very similar to the list app, with the main difference being that the list app assumes a single user while this app allows all users to add to the same list and "like" submissions.

        This example uses a list of crowdsourced information for simplicity, but you could display any kind of information in many different formats.

        # Decision Maker

        Similar to the quiz app, a decision tree app asks the user a series of questions. The primary difference between the two is that a decision tree doesn't check for right or wrong answers, but instead attempts to give the user a suggestion or help them make a decision based on their answers.

        This simple decision maker asks only three questions,  but more advanced ones actually take the form of a tree as seen below:

        Depending on the user's answer to each question, they're given a different page for the next question. This allows the app to gradually narrow down the decision one question at a time. This type of app can be really useful to help users understand complex processes - for example, you might introduce a recycling program by using a decision tree app to help users figure out which bin to sort items into - first asking what material it's made out of, then whether it is clean or not, and so on.

        # Improving and Iterating

        You've put your app in front of users, gathered feedback, and identified bugs and new features - time to do something about it.

        # Do This

        Each team member is going to implement select features and bug fixes on their own version of the team's app. Start by selecting a sticky note from the **To Do** column of your team's chart and moving it to the **Doing** column. For each sticky you tackle:

        -   Add a comment to the top of your program describing the feature or bug fix you are implementing
        -   Work on your iteration until it works. Try to stay focused on only the single feature or bug that you've selected.
        -   When done, move your sticky to the **Done** column, pick a new one, and start the process over.

        # Linking Screens

        With all of your screens in place you can start adding events that will change the screens. When you're done with this step you'll actually have an interactive prototype!

        # Do This

        For each screen of your app:

        -   Find all of the button IDs
        -   For each button, add an event handler that watches that ID
        -   In each event handler, use `setScreen()` to move the the right screen
        -   Test it all out!

        Depending on the number of screens and buttons your app has, this can be a pretty involved process. Make sure that you test your work often, using `console.log()` blocks to debug any strange behavior with your app. When you think you've got the whole thing working, compare your app with other members of your group to see if they work the same.

        Now that you've had some practice with importing screens, it's time to start working on your team's app.

        # Do This

        Each member of your team is going to create their own copy of the app, with all of the team members' screens imported in. This will be your copy of the app, and the copy that you will start to add code to in the next lesson.

        -   Collect all of the sharing urls for your team's pages
            -   You can find the share url by going back to the last level of the previous lesson, or by finding the screen in your [projects directory](/projects)
        -   Import each of the screens, one at a time
            -   If you run into an ID error with one of the screens, discuss the issue with the screen's creator so it can be fixed and imported
        -   Delete the default "screen1"
        -   Set the main screen as the default

        Often you will want to get the text of a UI Element and use it to set the text of another element on the screen. Can you get the text from the dropdown when the user picks a new input and use it to set the text of the "choiceDisplay" label.
      CSDU6 - UI and Inputs - get set with text input: |-
        # setText and getText

        You've seen how to use getText and setText already. Can you make this app get the text the user typed once they hit enter and show it in the text area at the bottom?

        _Tip: The "change" event is triggered when the user clicks "enter" in a field. Use an event handler for the text input watching for the "change" event._
      CSDU6 - UI and Inputs - getNumber: |-
        # getNumber

        **Starter Code:** This program creates a simple calculator but **there is something wrong with it. Try putting in 2 + 2.**

        We can fix this by using `getNumber()` instead of `getText()`. Can you fix the program by changing `getText()` to `getNumber()`?
      CSDU6 - UI and Inputs - getNumber practice: |-
        # getNumber

        **Starter Code:** The program tries to update the valueDisplay whenever the slider value changes but it always sets the value to 10.

      CSDU6 - UI and Inputs - getText: |-
        # getText

        Try to set up an event handler that gets the text from the dropdown whenever a user selects a new item from the dropdown. You will need to use the getter `getText()`. Whenever you use a getter you should save it in a variable. Use `console.log()` to make sure it is working.

        It is a little weird that both buttons are on the screen at the same time. You don't need the stop alarm button until the alarm is on. Can you make the buttons only show when they are needed?

        -   You will want the stop alarm button to be hidden when the program starts. You can do this in design mode.

        Hint: When you click the trigger alarm button, you should change the text, hide the trigger alarm button, _and_ show the stop alarm button.

Can you find code that is repeated multiple places, or chunks of code that could be better understood of given a name? Don't forget that you can use parameters to write functions for repeated code that is _mostly_ the same, but varies a bit (such as setting color on multiple LEDs).

        Arrays can hold all sorts of data, like numbers, strings, and even other arrays. When we put an array inside another, this becomes a 2D array. The `buzzer.playSong()` block can be used to play songs that sound more precise with 2D arrays.

        The structure that you've been using to play notes looks like this:

        `buzzer.playNotes( [array of notes to play] , tempo of the whole song);`

        The main difference with `buzzer.playSong()` is each element inside the `[array of notes to play]`, is an array with two elements: the note you want to play, and the duration of the note. Sometime you'll want a quarter note in your song, other times you'll want a full note, or maybe somewhere in between. A full song might look something like this:

        `buzzer.playSong([

        # Null Notes

        You may have noticed that if you put the same note side-by-side in the array, the buzzer just plays that note as one long sound instead of as individual notes. In music we often want a break (or _rest_) between notes. You can get your buzzer to play a rest by sending it the value `null`.

        `null` is a special value that represents emptiness in computer science. `playNotes` plays each note for the same duration, so a `null` element in the array is just telling `playNotes` to play nothing for the same duration as everything else.

      Crack Random Substitution: |-
        # Break a random substitution cipher!

        This version of the tool gives you more information about the encrypted text and more options for how to try out different substitutions.

        ### Different ways to analyze text

        -   Play with some of the sorting options available in the Random substitution cipher tab to get different views on the letter frequencies in the input text as well as standard English text.

        ### Different ways to substitute

        -   To substitute a letter you can drag a blue letter of the alphabet directly underneath the orange letter you want changed in the original ciphertext.

        ### Play.  Always play.

        -   There are other ways to analyze and substitute characters that you can find by clicking on the buttons and trying out whatever you like.
        -   Remember: you can't break it :)

      Frequency Analysis: |-
        # Break a random substitution cipher!

        Messages encrypted with the **Caesar cipher** are very easy to crack. What if instead of shifting the whole alphabet, we mapped every letter of the alphabet to a random different letter of the alphabet? This is called a **random substitution cipher**.

        In this version of the tool, you'll be interacting more with the graphs that show letter frequency. By analyzing the frequency of the letters in the encrypted input message compared to the frequency of letters in a typical piece of English prose, you can start to narrow in on what some of the letter mappings might be. Did you know that _'E'_ is the most common letter used in the English language? Maybe the most common letter in your encrypted text maps to the letter _'E'_, but maybe not! You'll have to do a bit of guess and check to see if that substitution makes sense.

        # Do this

        -   Load the **Sample message (hard)** from the message dropdown. This will load a message that has been encrypted with a random substitution cipher.\
            ![](https://images.code.org/04c6230c9607110126581c298bc09183-image-1443569176380.gif)

        -   You will crack the message by guessing what each letter of the alphabet contained in the original ciphertext should be changed to. You can do so by dragging the blue letters of the alphabet directly underneath the orange letter you want changed in the original ciphertext. Letters that have been changed using your guesses will no longer be highlighted orange in the message window on the left.

        -   Play with some of the sorting options available in the Random substitution cipher tab to get different views on the letter frequencies in the input text as well as standard English text.

        See how long it takes you to crack the cipher! Is this a good method of encrypting secret data?

      Gamelab StartScreen Change State: |-
        # Changing the State

        Now that you can display a different screen according to the state of your program, you will need a way to change between states.  To go from the "starting" state to the "playing" state, you can have the user press the "s" key.  You'll **only** want the program to check for the key press when the program is in the "starting" state, so your code for this will go inside the "starting" conditional.  Putting one `if` block inside another is called **nesting** conditionals.

        ## Do this

        -   Inside the `if` statement that checks for "starting", add in a new `if` statement that checks whether the user has pressed the "s" key.  (`if (keyDown("s")) {`)
        -   Inside your new `if` statement, set the value of your `gameState` variable to "playing". (`gameState = "playing";`)
        -   Test the code by starting the game and pressing "s".  The game should start playing after the key is pressed.

        If the game isn't starting on the start screen, double check that when the `gameState` variable is created at the beginning of the program, its value is "starting".  (`var gameState = "starting";`)
      Gamelab StartScreen Check State: |-
        # Checking Game State

        Now that you have your game state stored in a variable, you can check it to determine what should be displayed.  This should happen inside the draw loop, since it's something that will change as the program is being run.  The program should check whether the game is in the "playing" state, and only run the program if it is.  We can worry about the other states later.

        ## Do This

        -   Inside the draw loop, add a conditional (`if` statement).
        -   For the condition, check if `gameState == "playing"`.
        -   Move the rest of the code from the draw loop inside the `if` statement, so it only runs if the game is "playing".
        -   Run the program.  Nothing should happen because the game is still in the "starting" state.
        -   Go back to where you set the value of your `gameState` variable and change it from "starting" to "playing".
        -   Run the game again, and it should play normally, because it is now in the "playing" state.
        -   Change the value of the variable back to "starting".

        (It is important to find ways to check your code as you go, rather than wait until the end of many complex changes to run it.  By checking both the playing and starting states, you know that your conditional is working properly and that the game should play while in the "playing" state.)
      Gamelab StartScreen Check States: |-
        # Check all States

        Right now the only state your program can deal with is "playing", but you can add more conditionals to account for the other three states.

        ## Do this

        -   Inside the draw loop, add in three more `if` statements that check for `gameState == "starting"`, `gameState == "won"`, and `gameState == "lost"`, respectively.
        -   Inside each `if` statement, add code that will draw text to the screen, so you can see the results of the different states.  You may also want to use `drawSprites` so you can see the background image and the player sprites, but make sure you are drawing the text on top of the sprites.
        -   Check your code by running the program in the different states.  (Don't worry about making them perfect yet, just make sure that the conditionals are working as they should.)

        In order to keep track of your code, you might find it useful to create a function for each of the different text displays, then call those functions inside the conditionals.
      Gamelab StartScreen End Game: |-
        # Ending the Game

        Next, you'll need to add code that changes the state of the game when you lose.   Scroll down to the bottom of the program, to the `gameStatus` function.  Inside the function, the program checks the score and lives variables to check whether the use should win or lose the game.  Instead of displaying a win or lose message, you'll want to change the state of the game to "won" or "lost";

        ## Do this

        -   Inside the `gameStatus` function, replace the code `text("You Won!", 35, 200);` with `gameState = "won"`.
        -   Inside the `gameStatus` function, replace the code `text("You Lost!", 35, 200);` with `gameState = "lost"`.
        -   Check your code by running the game and losing.
        -   Check your code by running the game and winning.

        (To make the game much easier to win, change the original number of lives to 1000 by replacing `var lives = 3;` to `var lives = 1000;`.)
      Gamelab StartScreen Hide Sprites: |-
        # Hide and Show Sprites

        You may prefer that the platform, coin, and rock sprites only be visible when the game is playing.  You can change the game setup to set their visible property to `false` at the beginning of the game, then set it to `true` when you start the game, then `false` again when the game is won or lost.

        ## Do this

        -   Add code after you create your platforms, gold, and rocks sprite groups that sets those sprite groups' visible properties to `false` (e.g. `platforms.setVisibileEach(false);` )
        -   In the same  three places where you set `gameState = "playing";`, set the sprite groups' visible properties to `true`.
        -   In the same places where you set `gameState = "lost";` and `gameState = "won";`, set the sprite groups' visible
        -   Check your code by running the game and losing and restarting the game.
        -   Check your code by running the game and winning and restarting the game.
      Gamelab StartScreen Intro: |-
        # Start and End Screens

        This tutorial will teach you how to make start and end screens in Game Lab, as well as restart the game from the end screen.

        Hit run to play the game on the left.  Follow the instructions on the start screen to play.  Once the game is over, follow the instructions on the end screen to restart the game.

        In the next bubble, you'll see the code for game play and start to add your own start and end screens.

        ## Start Screen

        The start screen is the introductory screen that appears before the user starts playing the game.  It usually has the title of the game and some basic instructions for playing.  It might also include the game developer.

        ## End Screen

        The end screen appears after the user has won or lost the game.  It sometimes includes the final score, player rankings or other information.  It can also have an option to play the game again.
      Gamelab StartScreen Restart Game: |-
        # Restarting the Game

        Last, you'll need to add code that restarts the game.   This is similar to how you started the game by having the user press the "s" key.  This time, you'll need to check during the "lost" and "won" states.  If the user presses the "r" key during on of these states, you should restart the game by setting the `gameState` to "playing" and also resetting the `score` and `lives` variables to 0 and 3, respectively.

        ## Do this

        -   Inside the `if (gameState == "lost") {` statement, add an if statement that checks whether the user has pressed the "r" key.
        -   Inside your new `if` statement, set `score` to 0, `lives` to 3, and `gameState` to "playing".
        -   Inside the `if (gameState == "won") {` statement, add an if statement that checks whether the user has pressed the "r" key.
        -   Inside your new `if` statement, set `score` to 0, `lives` to 3, and `gameState` to "playing".
        -   Inside the `gameStatus` function, replace the code `text("You Lost!", 35, 200);` with `gameState = "lost"`.
        -   Check your code by running the game and losing and restarting the game.
        -   Check your code by running the game and winning and restarting the game.
      Gamelab StartScreen State: |-
        # Game State Variable

        Our sample game had four different scenarios (or **states**) that we need to keep track of in order to display the right screen: "starting", "playing", "won", and "lost".  The first step in adding a start or end screen to the game is creating a variable to keep track of any changes in the state of the game.

        ## Do This

        -   Declare a variable called `gameState` at the beginning of the program.  (A good place to do this would be near where `score` and `lives` are declared.
        -   Set the initial value of  your `gameState` variable to "starting"

        (Because you are not using this variable yet, you will see a warning triangle next to the line where it is declared.  It also will not affect how the program runs.)
      Gamelab StartScreen base code: |-
        # Game Code

        This is the code for the game without the start and end screens.  The function `gameStatus` (called on line 43 and defined on line 208) checks whether the user has won or lost, but it only adds a text message to the screen.  Gameplay also continues even after the game is over.

        ## Do This

        Read the code, in particular the code before the draw loop (lines 1-24), inside the draw loop (lines 27-43), and inside the `gameStatus` function (lines 209-224).  It's okay if you don't understand everything in the game, but you should see that the code before the draw loop sets up the sprites, and the code inside the draw loop controls the gameplay.

        Watch this video that defines "events" and shows how they work in CS Fundamentals. Afterwards, you will try some puzzles that require you to code events.

        > An event is a line of code that tells your computer to "listen" for something to happen, then take an action. For example, on web pages, you often can display a drop down menu when you roll over the navigation bar with your mouse. The "mouse rollover" is an "event" that triggers an action.

        # Best Practices > Meta-Cognitive Problem Solving

        Explicitly teaching meta-cognitive problem solving strategies before, during and after coding is extremely important in helping students process their learning. Mega-cognitive problem solving involves thinking about your thought process itself, and reflecting on _how_ you solve problems. Watch the video below to learn about Code.org's "Puzzle Solving Recipe" that can help students have success with difficult problems:

        [This worksheet](http://code.org/curriculum/docs/k-5/PuzzleSolvingStudent.png) details the different steps of the Puzzle Solving Recipe.

        ## Looking Ahead > Getting "Unplugged"

        In teaching computer science, you might think it would be best to have access to top tier technology -- new computers, fast Internet, the latest apps. But at Code.org, we've found that some of the most impactful computer science lessons are actually "unplugged," or conducted with little to no technology at all. In these lessons, students learn computer concepts without a computer.

        That's why all of our CS Fundamentals courses use unplugged activities to introduce computer science concepts with physical manipulatives before students write computer programs using those concepts. An example of this would be doing a dance of repeated movements with the class to understand the concept of how loops repeat commands in a computer program. This way when the students go on to writing programs using loops, the unplugged activity has set them up with something they are already familiar with and they can relate this new concept back to that activity.

        Watch the video below to understand the benefits of using unplugged activities to teach computer science.

        **As you work your way through Stages 4-8**, you'll have a chance to review some of our unplugged activities for each of the core concepts covered in this course.

        Open the door if they have the key!

        # Do This

        -   Add an `onEvent` block for clicking on the door
        -   Add an `if` statement inside the `onEvent` to check if the key position has moved to the bottom of the screen
            -   Add an if statement
            -   In the if statement add the `==`
            -   On one side of the `==` put the x position you move the key to when it is clicked
            -   On the other side add the `getXPosition()` block - The ID for that should be the ID of your key!
        -   Inside the `if` statement use `showElement` to show the hidden outdoors image if they got the key

        # Move Picture

        Now make it so the user can find the secret code by clicking the picture. When they click the picture it should move up and out of the way.

        # Do This

        -   Pull out an `onEvent` block
        -   Change the id spot in the `onEvent` block to picture (which is the ID of the picture element)
        -   Inside the `onEvent` block add the `setPosition` block with the following inputs
            -   ID: picture
            -   The next two inputs are x and y values - test out some numbers to try to get the picture to move like in the pictures on the right
      Room Escape Workshop - 4: "# Setting Up the Safe\n\nYou have generated a secret
        code and made it so users can navigate to the second room. Lets give the user
        the ability to enter the secret code when they click on the safe\n\n# Do This\n\n-
        \  Add an `onEvent` block\n    -   Pick the ID for the safe\n-   Inside the
        `onEvent` block add a <img src=\"https://images.code.org/c0964a8543728d018d5d9583319e22b9-image-1491060910093.34.36

        _x_ (the name of the variable) to be _guess_ \n    -   On the right side change
        _\"Enter a value\"_ (the prompt to ask the user) to _\"Enter the code\"_"
      Room Escape Workshop - 5: "# Checking the Secret Code\n\nNow that you have collected
        a guess of the secret code from the user you will need to check if it is correct!
        We can do this using an `if` statement. An if statement checks if a condition
        is true, in this case it will check if the number the user entered is equal
        to the secret code\n\n# Do This\n\n-   Inside the `onEvent` block for the
        safe below the prompt command add an <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5e9a434b1ad6b8f010db928b668127a5-image-1491061131564.37.01

        # Creating a digital prototype

        Using the prototype to the right (click the image to enlarge it) you're going to create a digital prototype of the example app "Recycling Finder". We've already added a few of the elements for you, including the title, but it doesn't look quite right yet. We'll go over each element of this as we go, but for now let's **just focus on the title**.

        # Do This

        -   **Make sure you are in Design Mode,** the switch appears above your app window on the left.
        -   **Click on the title text** to view its properties.
        -   **Change the property "text"** to "Recycling Finder".
        -   **Change the "font size"** to make the title larger.
        -   **Change the "text alignment"** so the title is centered on the screen.

        Buttons allow your user to interact with your app. This prototype screen will need three buttons (each shaded gray on the prototype.) We've already added the Search button, so you just need to add Contact and About.

        # Do This

        -   **Drag out a new "button" element** for each of the two remaining buttons.
        -   **Change the ids** to match the prototype.
        -   **Change the text** to match the prototype.
        -   **Modify other properties** to make the screen look like you'd like.
