        # 3 Bit Colors

        Each pixel is a square on a screen that emits light. Each pixel can have a certain number of bits assigned to it, and bits per pixel determine the colors that can be rendered.

        In this tool we're using 3 bits to define the one large black pixel. The first bit affects the red tint. The second bit affects the green tint. The third bit affects the blue tint.

        # Do This

        -   Click the "Run" button to start the widget
        -   Click on the light bulbs to turn on or off each color and see what happens to your pixel
        -   See how many different colors you can create with just three bits
        -   Write down the binary associated with each color you come up with

        # Filtering Pixels

        If you've ever used Instagram you've probably encountered an image filter. Image filters read in each pixel, process it in some way, and the return the filtered pixel. In this tool we're going to start by filtering just a single pixel before moving on to a full image.

        # Do This

        -   Try changing the color drop downs in the Filter section
        -   Click on the top row of lightbulbs in the Diagram section to see how the filter will convert the input (top bulbs) to the output (bottom bulbs)
        -   Look at how the numbers in the Binary section reflect changes to the colors
        -   Based on how the bits change, can you formulate what replace is doing? Talk to your partner and see if you can figure it out.

        # Do This

        -   Using the color dropdowns in the filter section, build a filter that changes the value of more than one color channel
        -   Click on the top row of lightbulbs in the Diagram section to see how the filter will convert the input (top bulbs) to the output (bottom bulbs)

        # Combining Filters

        Sometimes you'll need to filter more than one pixel to get the color change that you want.

        # Do This

        Check out Mario, he's lookin' pretty good in his red hat and overalls. Your job it to set up the filter so he looks like Luigi, with a green hat and overalls.

        -   First, determine which bit(s) needs to change in order to the change you want
        -   Once you've figured out which bit needs changing, set the filter dropdown appropriately
        -   After you've got the filter working so that, try to come up with other filters that change _only_ his hat and overalls - how many different clothing colors can you come up with?

        # Filtering Images

        Now that we've seen how a single pixel can be filtered to change its color, let's try applying a filter to an image made of multiple pixels. The filter you create will be applied to each pixel in the image - and you still have the light bulbs available to experiment with how your filter will work with individual colors.

        # Do This

        Here's a picture of a red mushroom - you're going to try and turn it into a yellow mushroom.

        -   First, determine which bit needs to change in order to turn red into yellow
        -   Once you've figured out which bit needs changing, use the filter dropdowns to make all of the red areas turn yellow
        -   After you've got the filter working so that the red has turned yellow, see if you can come up with filters that turn the mushroom other colors

        <img src="https://images.code.org/c15636bda16e8792c59ac955332e37a5-image-1471372091393.22.56.png" style="float:right; width: 200px"/>
        Here's what our bird should look like. Use the filter to get him back to normal.

        -   Decide which colors (and so which bits) you need to change. You might need to write your thoughts with pencil and paper.
        -   Once you know which bits need changing, set the filter dropdown appropriately to test your answer
        -   After you've fixed the image, write down both your process and your final filter in the Level 6 section of your Activity Guide

        _How many tries did it take you to find the right filter?_

        <details>

        <summary><strong>What is whitespace?</strong>
        </summary>

        Whitespace refers to any character that shows up as a blank space on the screen, such as a space, a tab, or a new line. Whitespace helps separate different parts of the document to make it easier to read.  For example, in HTML code new elements are usually put on a new line, even though it doesn't make any difference in how the page is displayed.

        </details>
        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is indentation?</strong>
        </summary>

        Indentation is the placement of text farther to the right, or left, to separate it from surrounding text.  Indentation helps to convey the program's structure.  In HTML, elements that are inside other elements are usually indented.  Here is an example:

        <pre>
           &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is inside the "body" element.&lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;/body&gt;
        </pre>

        </details>
        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is formatting?</strong>
        </summary>

        Formatting is arranging text in a way that makes it easier to understand.  HTML is usually formatted using indentation.  That means that elements that are inside other elements are further to the right in code.  Here is an example:

        <pre>
           &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is inside the "body" element.&lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;/body&gt;
        </pre>

        </details>
        <details>
        <summary><strong>Why does the inspector sometimes stop working?</strong>
        </summary>

        Sometimes there are so many bugs in the HTML that the inspector cannot read the code properly and it stops working completely, even on the parts of the code that are correct.  Once the bugs are corrected, the inspector will work again.

        </details>
        </div>

        The way that you write your code can make it easier or harder to find bugs.  If you use **whitespace** and **indentation**, it will make it easier to read and easier to fix.

        # Do This

        -   Look at the code with your partner and discuss how you should format the code to make it easier to read.
        -   Make the code easier to read by adding new lines and indentation.
        -   Fix all the bugs so that your page matches the target page below.

Whitespace helps separate different parts of the document to make it easier to read.  For example, in HTML code new elements are usually put on a new line, even though it doesn't make any difference in how the page is displayed.
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is indentation?</strong></summary>
        Indentation is the placement of text farther to the right, or left, to separate it from surrounding text.  Indentation helps to convey the program's structure.  In HTML, elements that are inside other elements are usually indented.  Here is an example:
        <pre>
           &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is inside the "body" element.&lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;/body&gt;
        </pre>
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is formatting?</strong></summary>
        Formatting is arranging text in a way that makes it easier to understand.  HTML is usually formatted using indentation.  That means that elements that are inside other elements are further to the right in code.  Here is an example:
        <pre>
           &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is inside the "body" element.&lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;/body&gt;
        </pre>
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary><strong>Why does the inspector sometimes stop working?</strong></summary>

        Sometimes there are so many bugs in the HTML that the inspector cannot read the code properly and it stops working completely, even on the parts of the code that are correct.  Once the bugs are corrected, the inspector will work again.

        </details>
        </div>

        The way that you write your code can make it easier or harder to find bugs.  If you use **whitespace** and **indentation**, it will make it easier to read and easier to fix.

        # Do This

        -   Look at the code with your partner and discuss how you should format the code to make it easier to read.
        -   Make the code easier to read by adding new lines and indentation.
        -   Fix all the bugs so that your page matches the target page below.

        ::: विवरण [** व्हाइट स्पेस क्या है? **]
        व्हाइट स्पेस किसी भी अक्षर (करैक्टर  )को संदर्भित करता है जो स्क्रीन पर रिक्त स्थान के रूप में दिखाई देता है, जैसे कि एक स्थान, एक टैब या एक नई पंक्ति। व्हाइट स्पेस दस्तावेज़ के अलग-अलग हिस्सों को पढ़ने में आसान बनाने में मदद करता है। उदाहरण के लिए, एचटीएमएल कोड में नए तत्वों को आमतौर पर एक नई लाइन में डाल दिया जाता है, भले ही यह पृष्ठ कैसे प्रदर्शित हो, इससे कोई अंतर नहीं पड़ता है।
        :::
        ::: विवरण [** इंडेंटेशन क्या है? **]
        इंडेंटेशन टेक्स्ट को दाईं ओर या बाईं ओर रखने के लिए है, इसे आसपास के टेक्स्ट से अलग करने के लिए। इंडेंटेशन प्रोग्राम की संरचना को व्यक्त करने में मदद करता है। HTML में, ऐसे तत्व जो अन्य तत्वों के अंदर होते हैं, वे आमतौर पर इंडेंट होते हैं। यहाँ एक उदाहरण है:

               <body>
                  <p>यह पैराग्राफ "body" के भीतर है .</p>
               </body>

        ::: विवरण [** प्रारूपण (फॉर्मेट) क्या है? **]
        फार्मेट करना याने पाठ को इस तरह से व्यवस्थित कर रहा है जिससे समझने में आसानी हो। HTML आमतौर पर इंडेंटेशन से फॉर्मेट किया जाता है। इसका मतलब है कि जो तत्व (एलेमेंट्स)अन्य तत्वों (एलेमेंट्स )के अंदर हैं वे कोड में दाईं ओर हैं। यहाँ एक उदाहरण है:

               <body>
                  <p>This paragraph is inside the "body" element.</p>
               </body>

        :::
        ::: विवरण [** निरीक्षक (कोड इंस्पेक्टर) कभी-कभी काम करना क्यों बंद कर देता है? **]

        कभी-कभी HTML में बहुत सारे बग्स होते हैं.  और कोड इंस्पेक्टर कोड को ठीक से नहीं पढ़ सकता है और यह कोड के उन हिस्सों पर भी काम करना बंद कर देता है जो सही हैं। एक बार बग्स हट जाने के बाद, कोड इंस्पेक्टर फिर से काम करेगा।

        :::

        </div>

        जिस तरह से आप अपना कोड लिखते हैं, उससे बग ढूंढना आसान या कठिन हो सकता है। यदि आप \*\* व्हाइट स्पेस \*\* और \*\* इंडेंटेशन \*\* का उपयोग करते हैं, तो यह पढ़ने में आसान और ठीक करने में आसान बना देगा।

        # यह करो

        -   अपने साथी के साथ कोड को देखें और चर्चा करें कि आपको कोड को प्रारूपित (फॉर्मेट) कैसे करना चाहिए जिससे इसे पढ़ने में आसानी हो।
        -   नई लाइनें और इंडेंटेशन जोड़कर कोड को पढ़ना आसान बनाएं।
        -   सभी बग्स को ठीक करें ताकि आपका पेज नीचे दिए गए लक्ष्य पृष्ठ से मेल खाए।

        # चित्र (इमेज) जोड़ना

        <div class="no-pullthrough" style="float: right; height: 250px; width: 40%; overflow-y: scroll; margin-left: 20px; font-size:14px">

        ::: विवरण [** मैं चित्र (इमेज) कैसे जोड़ूं? **]

        `<Img>` टैग आपको अपने वेब पेज पर चित्र (इमेज) दिखाने की अनुमति देता है। <br> <br>

        उदाहरण:

            <img src = "dog.png" alt = "डॉग जंपिंग">

        ब्राउज़र को यह बताने के लिए कि कौन सी फ़ाइल का उपयोग करना है, अतिरिक्त जानकारी, जिसे \*\* विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट) \*\* कहा जाता है, कोष्ठक के अंदर <img> टैग में जोड़ा जाता है। विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट) `src` का अर्थ है \*\* source और छवि (इमेज) का नाम बताएं। छवि (इमेज) फ़ाइलों के नाम में एक्सटेंशन शामिल हैं जो कंप्यूटर को बताते हैं कि वे किस प्रकार की छवि (इमेज) के साथ काम कर रहे हैं। सामान्य एक्सटेंशन .jpg, .jpeg, .png हैं। <br> <br>

        Src विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट) के अलावा, छवि (इमेज) तत्वों में छवि (इमेज) का वर्णन करने वाले `alt` विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट) भी होती हैं। यह उस स्थिति में महत्वपूर्ण है जब छवि (इमेज) उन लोगों के लिए या उन लोगों के लिए नहीं है जो उनकी दृष्टि से परेशान हैं। <br> <br>

        एक `<img>` टैग \*\* सेल्फ-क्लोजिंग टैग \*\* का एक उदाहरण है क्योंकि यह एक टैग में शुरू और बंद होता है।

        :::

        ::: विवरण [** क्यों एक इमेज टैग में अंतिम टैग नहीं है? **]
        एक इमेज टैग को अंतिम टैग की आवश्यकता नहीं है क्योंकि उसमें कोई पाठ सामग्री (टेक्स्ट ) नहीं है जिसे टैग में लपेटा जाना चाहिए। स्क्रीन पर दिखाई जाने वाली सामग्री टैग विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट)ओं के माध्यम से निर्दिष्ट की जाती है।
        :::

        ::: विवरण [** एक विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट) (एट्रिब्युट) क्या है? **]

        विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट)एँ एक टैग में शामिल अतिरिक्त जानकारी हैं। गुण के नाम और मूल्य हैं। नाम बताता है कि किस प्रकार की जानकारी प्रदान की जा रही है और फिर मूल्य उस टैग के लिए विशिष्ट जानकारी देता है।

        उदाहरण के लिए `<img>` टैग में दो विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट)एँ हैं, src और alt। src छवि (इमेज) फ़ाइल का नाम निर्दिष्ट करता है और alt ब्राउज़र को पठनीय पाठ में बताता है कि छवि (इमेज) क्या है।

        :::

        \</ div>

        # इमेजिस

        आपके लिए एक डॉग बनाम कैट वेब पेज शुरू किया गया है। कुत्ते की छवि (इमेज) को पहले से ही नीचे वेब पेज पर जोड़ा गया है। उस कोड को देखें जिसमें कुत्ते की छवि (इमेज) दिखाई दे रही है, फिर बिल्ली शीर्षक के नीचे पृष्ठ पर `cat.jpeg` छवि (इमेज) जोड़ने के लिए एक छवि (इमेज) टैग का उपयोग करें।

        यह छवि (इमेज) पिक्सबे में पाई गई थी और इसे उपयोगकर्ता "अलेक्सस \\ \_फोटोस" द्वारा अपलोड किया गया था, जिसने "व्यावसायिक उपयोग के लिए मुक्त" और "कोई आवश्यक नहीं" लाइसेंस का उपयोग किया था।

        ::: विवरण [** मैं चित्र  (इमेज)कैसे जोड़ूं? **]

        `<Img>` टैग आपको अपने वेब पेज पर चित्र  (इमेज)दिखाने की अनुमति देता है।

        उदाहरण:

            <img src = "dog.png" alt = "डॉग जंपिंग">

        ब्राउज़र को यह बताने के लिए कि कौन सी फ़ाइल का उपयोग करना है, अतिरिक्त जानकारी, जिसे \*\* विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट) \*\* कहा जाता है, कोष्ठक के अंदर <img> टैग में जोड़ा जाता है। विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट) `src` का अर्थ है \*\* source और छवि (इमेज) का नाम बताएं। छवि (इमेज) फ़ाइलों के नाम में एक्सटेंशन शामिल हैं जो कंप्यूटर को बताते हैं कि वे किस प्रकार की छवि (इमेज) के साथ काम कर रहे हैं। सामान्य एक्सटेंशन .jpg, .jpeg, .png हैं। <br> <br>

        src विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट) के अलावा, छवि (इमेज) तत्वों में छवि (इमेज) का वर्णन करने वाले `alt` विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट) भी होती हैं। यह तब काम आता है जब छवि (इमेज) लोड ना हो या उन लोगों के लिए जिनकी दृष्टी कमजोर है । <br> <br>

        एक `<img>` टैग एक \*\* स्व-समापन टैग \*\* का उदाहरण है क्योंकि यह एक टैग में शुरू और बंद होता है।
        :::

        ::: विवरण [** क्यों एक इमेज टैग में अंतिम टैग नहीं है? **]
        एक इमेज टैग को अंतिम टैग की आवश्यकता नहीं है क्योंकि उसमें कोई पाठ सामग्री (टेक्स्ट ) नहीं है जिसे टैग में लपेटा जाना चाहिए। स्क्रीन पर दिखाई जाने वाली सामग्री टैग विशेषताओं (एट्रिब्युटस ) के माध्यम से निर्दिष्ट की जाती है।
        :::
        ::: विवरण [** एक विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट) क्या है? **]

        विशेषताएं (एट्रिब्युटस)  एक टैग में शामिल अतिरिक्त जानकारी हैं। गुण के नाम और मूल्य हैं। नाम बताता है कि किस प्रकार की जानकारी प्रदान की जा रही है और फिर मूल्य उस टैग के लिए विशिष्ट जानकारी देता है।

        उदाहरण के लिए `<img>` टैग में दो विशेषताएं (एट्रिब्युटस) हैं, src और alt। src छवि (इमेज)  फ़ाइल का नाम निर्दिष्ट करता है और alt ब्राउज़र को टेक्स्ट में बताता है कि छवि (इमेज) क्या है।

        :::

        </div>

        # विवरण आवश्यक है

        `Src` विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट) में आपको उस छवि (इमेज) के सही फ़ाइल का नाम बताना पड़ता हैं। इसका मतलब है कि आपको स्पेलिंग, कैपिटलाइज़ेशन और फ़ाइल एक्सटेंशन पर ध्यान देना पड़ेगा। इस पृष्ठ की तीन छवियां (इमेज) अनुचित `src` विशेषता (एट्रिब्युट) के कारण नहीं दिखाई देती। संदर्भ के लिए फ़ाइल मेनू का उपयोग करना, प्रत्येक छवि (इमेज) टैग को ठीक करना।

        _Note: भले ही छवि (इमेज)यां ठीक से लोड नहीं हो रही हैं, हमारी वेबसाइट अभी भी टेक्स्ट दिखा रही है कि वहां क्या होना चाहिए क्योंकि हमने `alt` विशेषताओं (एट्रिब्युटस) का उपयोग किया था। ठंडा!_

        <summary><strong>What is a style sheet?</strong></summary>
        A style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.

        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is CSS?</strong></summary>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        </pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        <summary><strong>What should I name my style sheet?</strong></summary>

        You can name your style sheet anything, but it's better to choose a relevant name, such as "style.css" or "aboutmestyles.css" so that it's clear what the file is.  Your file should always end in the ".css" extension.

        # Adding a Style Sheet

        This is your project from before.  In the next level, you'll have a chance to add some different styles to it, but first, you need to add a style sheet, name it, and link it to your html page.

        1.  Create a new style sheet for your project.
        2.  Rename the style sheet file.
        3.  Add your style sheet to your HTML page.

        <strong>What is a style sheet?</strong>
        </summary>

        A style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.

        <strong>What is CSS?</strong>
        </summary>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        </pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        <summary>
        <strong>What should I name my style sheet?</strong>
        </summary>
        You can name your style sheet anything, but it's better to choose a relevant name, such as "style.css" or "aboutmestyles.css" so that it's clear what the file is.  Your file should always end in the ".css" extension.

        <summary>
        <strong>How does the code work?</strong>

        </summary>
        For the code to work, you need to both create a winter class and add elements to the class.

        The class is created in the style sheet, with the following code.

        <pre>.winter {
          color: rgb(195,230,255);
        }</pre>

        This code creates a class called `winter` and makes everything in the class our winter blue, which has the RGB values of (195,230,255).

        The code that adds a `h5` element to the winter class is `<h5 class="winter">`.  The `class=winter` inside the opening tag adds everything inside the tag to the class.

        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>
        <strong>What rules can be added to a class rule-set?</strong>

        </summary>

        A class rule-set can have the same rules as any other type of selector.  If a rule does not apply to the content of the class (for example, using `font-size` on an element with no text), then the computer will ignore that rule, but still use the rules that work.

        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>
        <strong>Why does the selector have a period in front of it?</strong>

        </summary>
        In CSS, a period in front of a selector means that the selector is the name of a class.  If there is no period, it means that the selector is the name of an HTML tag.
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>
        <strong>Why would a web developer use classes?</strong>

        </summary>
        A web developer uses classes when some elements should be styled differently than others, even if they are the same tag.  Classes can also be used to give elements that have different tags the same style.
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>
        <strong>I got different RGB values, but mine are right, too.</strong>

        </summary>

        Because RGB creates millions of different colors, some are so similar that people have a hard time telling them apart.  That means that there are multiple RGB values that are close enough to work for our winter color.

        </details>
        </div>

        Your winter words should all have the same color and font.

        -   Find the CSS rule-set in the style sheet that gives the winter words their style.
        -   Add a rule that changes the font of the winter words.  It can be any font, but it will need to be different from that of the other three seasons.

        <strong>How does the code work?</strong>

        </summary>
        For the code to work, you need to both create a spring class and add elements to the class.

        The spring class is already created in the style sheet, but it doesn't have any rules.

        <pre>.spring {
          color: rgb(195,230,255);
        }</pre>

        Look at the rules in the `winter` class for clues to how to make rules for the summer class.

        You will also need to add some elements to the spring class inside your HTML file.

        The code in the HTML file that adds a `h5` element to the winter class is `<h5 class="winter">`.  Use this pattern to add elements to the spring class, too.

        A class rule-set can have the same rules as any other type of selector.  If a rule does not apply to the content of the class (for example, using `font-size` on an element with no text), then the computer will ignore that rule, but still use the rules that work.

        Whitespace refers to any character that shows up as a blank space on the screen, such as a space, a tab, or a new line. Whitespace helps separate different parts of the document to make it easier to read.  For example, in HTML code new elements are usually put on a new line, even though it doesn't make any difference in how the page is displayed.

        Indentation is the placement of text farther to the right, or left, to separate it from surrounding text.  Indentation helps to convey the program's structure.  In HTML, elements that are inside other elements are usually indented.  Here is an example:
        <pre>

        इंडेंटेशन टेक्स्ट को दाईं ओर या बाईं ओर रखने के लिए है, इसे आसपास के टेक्स्ट से अलग करने के लिए। इंडेंटेशन प्रोग्राम की संरचना को व्यक्त करने में मदद करता है। HTML में, ऐसे तत्व जो अन्य तत्वों के अंदर होते हैं, वे आमतौर पर इंडेंट होते हैं। यहाँ एक उदाहरण है:

               <body>
                  <p>यह पैराग्राफ "body" के भीतर है .</p>

        <strong>What is CSS?</strong>
        </summary>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>
        h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        }
        </pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        -   Look through web page below for new styles.
        -   Open the style sheet
        -   With your partner, discuss which parts of the CSS code you think are making the page appear different.
            -   What makes the entire page blue?
            -   How are the images positioned to the left of all the other elements?
            -   What made the image corners rounded?

        In the next few levels, you'll be changing and adding new styles on this page.

        Hyperlinks can connect to local web pages or external web pages. To add navigation to your website you will need to add hyperlinks which connect your individual web pages. You can **add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element**.  The text you want to display as the hyperlink goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags. The `<a>` element has an attribute `href` which is the location to link to.  The location of a local page is just the file path for that page. <br> <br>

        For example to link to the unique houses page you would add the following code inside your `<body>` element. <br><br>

        <pre>
        &lt;a href=”houses.html”&gt; Unique Houses &lt;/a&gt;

        <summary><strong>What are the two types of lists?</strong>
        </summary>
         There are two types of lists in HTML, ordered and unordered lists.
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is an unordered list?</strong>
        </summary>

        An unordered list is just a set of bulleted items.

        An unordered list element has the tag `<ul> </ul>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>U</strong>nordered <strong>L</strong>ist. Each item in the list is marked by a list item element `<li> </li>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>I</strong>tem.  The list item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent element, the unordered list.

        </details>

        <details>
        <summary><strong>How do I make an unordered list?</strong>
        </summary>

        Making an unordered list has two steps: making the list and adding the list items.  To make the unordered list, write the unordered list tags `<ul> </ul>`.  Next, add your list items **inside** the unordered list tags.  To make each list item, use the list item tags `<li> </li>` and write the list item inside the tags.

        It can be helpful to indent your `<li> </li>` tags so it's clear they are contained in the `<ul> </ul>` tags.

        </details>

        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is an ordered list?</strong>
        </summary>

        An ordered list is a set of bulleted items which are numbered.

        An ordered list element has the tags `<ol> </ol>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>O</strong>rdered <strong>L</strong>ist. Each item in the list is marked by a list item element `<li> </li>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>I</strong>tem.  The list item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent element, the ordered list.

        </summary>

        Making an ordered list has two steps: making the list and adding the list items. To make the ordered list, write the ordered list tags `<ol> </ol>`. Next, add your list items **inside** the ordered list tags. To make each list item, use the list item tags `<li> </li>` and write the list item inside the tags.

        It can be helpful to indent your `<li> </li>` tags so it's clear they are contained in the `<ol> </ol>` tags.

        </details>
        </div>

        You can also use HTML to make different types of lists on your web page.  This recipe includes two different types of lists, one ordered (with numbers) and one unordered (with bullets).

        # Do This

        <strong>What are the two types of lists?</strong>
        </summary>
         There are two types of lists in HTML, ordered and unordered lists.

        <strong>What is an unordered list?</strong>
        </summary>

        An unordered list is just a set of bulleted items.

        An unordered list element has the tag `<ul> </ul>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>U</strong>nordered <strong>L</strong>ist. Each item in the list is marked by a list item element `<li> </li>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>I</strong>tem.  The list item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent element, the unordered list.

        </details>

        <details>
        <summary>
        <strong>How do I make an unordered list?</strong>
        </summary>

        Making an unordered list has two steps: making the list and adding the list items.  To make the unordered list, write the unordered list tags `<ul> </ul>`.  Next, add your list items **inside** the unordered list tags.  To make each list item, use the list item tags `<li> </li>` and write the list item inside the tags.
        <br /><br />
        It can be helpful to indent your `<li> </li>` tags so it's clear they are contained in the `<ul> </ul>` tags.

        <strong>What is an ordered list?</strong>
        </summary>

        An ordered list is a set of bulleted items which are numbered.

        An ordered list element has the tags `<ol> </ol>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>O</strong>rdered <strong>L</strong>ist. Each item in the list is marked by a list item element `<li> </li>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>I</strong>tem.  The list item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent element, the ordered list.

        You can also use HTML to make different types of lists on your web page.  This recipe includes two different types of lists, one ordered (with numbers) and one unordered (with bullets).

        # Do This

        -   Use the inspector tool to see the code that is making the two different kinds of lists.
        -   Make sure you and your partner agree on what the different tags do.

        ::: विवरण [** सूची के दो प्रकार क्या हैं? **]
         HTML में दो प्रकार की सूचियाँ हैं, क्रमबद्ध और क्रमहीन सूचियाँ।
        :::

        ::: विवरण [** एक अव्यवस्थित सूची क्या है? **]

        एक क्रमहीन सूची बुलेटेड वस्तुओं का एक सेट है।
        एक क्रमहीन सूची  में टैग \<<ul> \</ ul> है। यह <strong> U \</ strong> nordered <strong> L \</ strong> ist का संक्षिप्त नाम है। सूची में प्रत्येक आइटम को एक सूची आइटम तत्व `<li> </ li>` द्वारा चिह्नित किया गया है। यह <strong> L \</ strong> ist <strong> I \</ strong>tem का संक्षिप्त रूप है. सूची आइटम एक चाइल्ड एलिमेंट  है, जिसका अर्थ है कि यह अपने मूल तत्व क्रमहीन सूची के अंदर चला जाता है।

        :::

        ::: विवरण [** मैं एक अव्यवस्थित सूची कैसे बनाऊं? **]

        क्रमहीन सूची बनाने के दो चरण हैं: सूची बनाना और सूची आइटम जोड़ना। अनऑर्डर की गई लिस्ट बनाने के लिए, अनअॉर्डर लिस्ट टैग्स को \<<ul> \</ ul> लिखें। इसके बाद, अपनी सूची आइटम \*\* अंदर \*\* अनियंत्रित सूची टैग जोड़ें। प्रत्येक सूची आइटम बनाने के लिए, सूची आइटम टैग `<li> </ li> का उपयोग करें और टैग के अंदर सूची आइटम लिखें।
        <br /> <br />
        यह आपके`<li> \</ li> टैग को इंडेंट करने में मददगार हो सकता है इसलिए यह स्पष्ट है कि वे`<ul> </ ul>`टैग में समाहित हैं।
        :::

        ::: विवरण [**क्रमबद्ध सूची क्या है? **]

        क्रमबद्ध गई सूची बुलेटेड आइटमों का एक समूह है जो क्रमांकित हैं।

        क्रमबद्ध सूची में टैग्स हैं \<<ol> \</ ol> `। यह <strong> O </ strong> rdered <strong> L </ strong> ist का संक्षिप्त नाम है। सूची में प्रत्येक आइटम को एक सूची आइटम`<li> \</ li>\` द्वारा चिह्नित किया गया है। यह <strong> L \</ strong> ist <strong> I \</ strong> tem का संक्षिप्त रूप है.  सूची आइटम एक चाइल्ड एलिमेंट है, जिसका अर्थ है कि यह अपने मूल तत्व क्रमबद्ध सूची के अंदर जाता है, ।

        :::

        ::: विवरण [** मैं एक क्रमबद्ध सूची कैसे बनाऊं? **]

        क्रमबद्ध सूची बनाने के दो चरण हैं: सूची बनाना और सूची आइटम जोड़ना। आदेशित सूची बनाने के लिए, क्रमबद्ध सूची टैग `<ol> </ ol>` लिखें। इसके बाद, अपनी सूची आइटम \*\* के अंदर \*\* क्रमबद्ध  सूची टैग जोड़ें। प्रत्येक सूची आइटम बनाने के लिए, सूची आइटम टैग `<li> </ li> का उपयोग करें और टैग के अंदर सूची आइटम लिखें।

        यह आपके`<li> \</ li> टैग को इंडेंट करने में मददगार हो सकता है इसलिए यह स्पष्ट है कि वे\` <ol> \</ ol> टैग में समाहित हैं।

        :::

        \</ Div>

        अपने वेब पेज पर विभिन्न प्रकार की सूचियाँ बनाने के लिए आप HTML का भी उपयोग कर सकते हैं। इस रेसिपी में दो अलग-अलग प्रकार की सूचियाँ शामिल हैं, एक क्रमबद्ध (संख्याओं के साथ) और एक क्रमहीन (गोलियों के साथ)।

        # यह कर के देखो

        -   दो अलग-अलग प्रकार की सूचियों को बनाने वाले कोड को देखने के लिए निरीक्षक उपकरण (इंस्पेक्टर टूल  )का उपयोग करें।
        -   सुनिश्चित करें कि आप और आपके साथी इस बात पर सहमत हैं कि विभिन्न टैग क्या करते हैं।
        -   कोड को ठीक करें ताकि प्रत्येक सूची में दूसरा आइटम सही ढंग से प्रदर्शित हो

        <strong>What are hyperlinks?</strong>
        </summary>

        Hyperlinks can connect to local web pages or external web pages. To add navigation to your website you will need to add hyperlinks which connect your individual web pages. You can **add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element**.  The text you want to display as the hyperlink goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags. The `<a>` element has an attribute `href` which is the location to link to.  The location of a local page is just the file path for that page. <br> <br>

        For example to link to the unique houses page you would add the following code inside your `<body>` element. <br><br>

        <pre>
        &lt;a href=”houses.html”&gt; Unique Houses &lt;/a&gt;

        # Create a Navigation Bar

        Here's your project from before.  You'll be linking the two pages by creating a **navigation bar** at the top of the page.  Websites usually have the same navigation bar across all of their pages so you can get back and forth between things on the site.  You can see an example of a navigation bar on <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/weblab/2KO4FIjN89QPeYnTG_NzLIjroaG8daOY3jRl5uHm1Co/" target="_new">this page</a>

        # Do This

        -   In your home page (index.html), add two hyperlinks at the top of the page, one to your lists page, and one to the home page.
            -   _Even though it might seem strange to link a page to itself, it's less confusing if the navigation bar is exactly the same on every page._
        -   Copy the code for the navigation bar, then add it to the top of your lists page.
        -   Test your links in the preview area by clicking on them.

        ::: विवरण [** सूची के दो प्रकार क्या हैं? **]
         HTML में दो प्रकार की सूचियाँ हैं, क्रमबद्ध और क्रमहीन  सूचियाँ।
        :::

        ::: विवरण [** एक क्रमबद्ध सूची क्या है? **]

        एक क्रमबद्ध सूची बुलेटेड आइटमों का एक समूह है जो क्रमांकित हैं।
        <br /> <br />
        एक क्रमबद्ध सूची तत्व का टैग '<ol>' है। यह <strong> O \</ strong> rdered <strong> L \</ strong> ist का संक्षिप्त नाम है। सूची में प्रत्येक आइटम को एक सूची आइटम तत्व द्वारा चिह्नित किया जाता है `<li>`;; यह <strong> L \</ strong> ist <strong> I \</ strong> मंदिरों का संक्षिप्त नाम है। सूची आइटम तत्व एक चाइल्ड एलिमेंट  है, जिसका अर्थ है कि यह अपने मूल तत्व क्रमबद्ध सूची के अंदर जाता है,  (`<ol>`)।
        :::

        ::: विवरण [** मैं एक क्रमबद्ध सूची कैसे बनाऊं? **]

        क्रमबद्ध सूची बनाने के दो चरण हैं: सूची बनाना और सूची आइटम जोड़ना। क्रमबद्ध सूची बनाने के लिए, ऑर्डरड लिस्ट टैग `<ol> </ ol>` लिखें। इसके बाद, अपनी सूची आइटम \*\* के अंदर \*\* ऑर्डरड लिस्ट टैग जोड़ें। प्रत्येक सूची आइटम बनाने के लिए, लिस्ट आइटम  टैग \`<li> \</ li> का उपयोग करें और टैग के अंदर सूची आइटम लिखें।

        यह आपके `<li>` टैग को इंडेंट करने में मददगार हो सकता है इसलिए यह स्पष्ट है कि वे `<ol>` टैग में निहित हैं।

        <summary><strong>What is CSS?</strong></summary>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        </pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        <strong>What is CSS?</strong>
        </summary>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        }</pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        # Changing the Font

        -   Find the CSS rule-set in the style sheet that determines the style for the paragraph tag.
        -   Change the font family and choose which one you like the best.
            -   Choose from "serif", "sans-serif", "cursive", "fantasy", and "monospace"
        -   Add a font family rule for the h1 or h3 tags.

        # Making a new CSS rule-set

        The block of code that gives rules for a particular tag is called a _rule-set_.  You can make a new rule set by copying the pattern you see in the rule-set for the `h1` tag.

        -   Find the CSS rule-set in the style sheet that determines the styles for the h1 tag.

        </summary>
        CSS includes most common color names (red, blue, green, etc.), and many uncommon ones.  You can see a full list of CSS color names at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">W3Schools - HTML Color Names</a>.  You can still use colors that are not included in the named list, but you will need to use their RGB values.

        Here is the code that is making the `h1` header red:

        <pre>h1 {
          color: red;
        }</pre>

        -   `h1` is the _selector_.  It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces.
        -   `color: red;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `h1` tags red.
            -   `color` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the text color.
            -   `red` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the text red.

        <strong>How do I make a new rule-set?</strong>
        </summary>

        To make a new rule set, you'll need a selector and a list of rules.  The selector is the name of the tag you want the rules to be applied to.  The rules are a list of property and value pairs.  You'll also need to pay careful attention to the punctuation in the rule set.  Look at the code below for an example of how the code should look.  You'll need to change the specifics for your page.

        <pre>h1 {
          color: red;
        }</pre>

        -   `h1` is the _selector_.  It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces.
        -   `color: red;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `h1` tags red.
            -   `color` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the text color.
            -   `red` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the text red.

        <strong>Why do I need all the punctuation?</strong>
        </summary>

        The punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the style sheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.

        </summary>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;

        # Making a new CSS rule-set

        The block of code that gives rules for a particular tag is called a _rule-set_.  You can make a new rule set by copying the pattern you see in the rule-set for the `h1` tag.

        -   Find the CSS rule-set in the style sheet that determines the styles for the `h1` tag.
        -   Using the same pattern, write a new CSS rule-set that will determine the style for the `h3` tag.
        -   Add code to set a different color for the `h3` tags.

Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        </pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        # Text Alignment

        The `text-align` property sets the horizontal (side to side) position of the text within each line.

        -   Find the "text-align" property in the paragraph tag.
        -   Change the paragraph alignment.
            -   Choose from "left", "right", and "center"

        <strong>How does the code work?</strong>
        </summary>

        Here is the code that is controlling the paragraph text alignment:

        <pre>p {
          text-align: left;
        }</pre>

        -   `p` is the _selector_.  It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces. The `p` stands for paragraph.
        -   `text-align: left;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `p` tags align to the left side of the paragraph.
            -   `text-align` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the text alignment.
            -   `left` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the text align to the left side of the paragraph.

        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>
        <strong>Why doesn't <code>text-align: left;</code> do anything?</strong>
        </summary>

        Most properties have default values.  The default values are the styles that an element will have automatically, before you add your style sheet.  The default value for `text-align` is `left`, so it doesn't change from how it already looked.

        <strong>What are the possible values for text align?</strong>
        </summary>

        You can choose between "left", "right", and "center".  You can read more about the text-align property at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-align.asp" target="_new">W3Schools - CSS text-align Property</a>

        <details>
        <summary>
        <strong>Why do I need all the punctuation?</strong>
        </summary>

        The punctuation, such as the curly braces `{}`, the colon `:`, and the semicolon `;`, help the computer to understand the rules in the style sheet.  The curly braces hold all the rules for a particular selector.  Each rule should end in a semicolon, and the properties and values are always separated by a colon.

        A style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.

        <summary><strong>What is an unordered list?</strong>
        </summary>

        An unordered list is just a set of bulleted items.
        <br /><br />An unordered list element has the tag \<ul> . This is an abbreviation for <strong>U</strong>nordered <strong>L</strong>ist. Each item in the list is marked by a list item element \<li>. This is an abbreviation for <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>I</strong>tem.  The list item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent element, the unordered list (\<ul>).

        Making an unordered list has two steps: making the list and adding the list items.  To make the unordered list, write the unordered list tags `<ul></ul>`.  Next, add your list items **inside** the unordered list tags.  To make each list item, use the list item tags `<li></li>` and write the list item inside the tags.

        It can be helpful to indent your \<li> tags so it's clear they are contained in the \<ul> tag.

        # Do This

        Turn to a classmate and make a list of the following information.

        -   How many sprites are there in this game. Which are they?
        -   What variables are needed to make this game? What do they store?
        -   If you were to split the code of this game into functions what do you think they would be? What are the major pieces of behavior you'd need to create in your code?

        # Getting Started: Set Animations

        You should have already reviewed the planning guide for this project. A lot of the work to turn this project guide into a working game has already been started. Based on the project guide you're going to do the rest of this work.

        # Do This

        Before we get started you'll want some better animations for each of your sprites.

        -   In the Animation Tab are animations for each of your sprites. Go look at what they are.
        -   In your code give each sprite its appropriate animation. **Use the ones provided for now** but later you'll be able to go change them.
        -   Head to [Level 4](/s/csd3-2017/stage/20/puzzle/4) if you need help remembering how to do this.

        # Change Player Animations

        Right now your player is always facing the same direction. You can make things look a lot more realistic by switching between animations. Your player should switch between a left-facing and right-facing animation depending on which key was last pressed. Remember, you can quickly copy and edit animations inside the Animation Tab.

        # Do This

        -   Inside the Animation Tab copy the animation of your player sprite.
        -   Flip each frame of the new animation so that the sprite is facing in the opposite direction.
        -   Rename your new animation.

        -   The sprite should move up, down, left, and right if the corresponding arrow key is pressed.
        -   The sprite should _not_ go all the way off the screen in any direction.

        # Do This Together

        Before you tackle writing this program, you'll need to figure out how to check multiple conditions at once.

        -   **Brainstorm** with your neighbors ways you might check for more than one condition.
        -   **Share** back with the whole class so you can see other potential approaches.
        -   **Explore** the toolbox for blocks that might help (pay extra attention to the Math and Control drawers).

        Sprites have properties that let the computer know where and how to draw them. Two common properties to use are `sprite.x` and `sprite.y` which control the location of the sprite. Assigning these properties a new value will move your sprite to a new location on the screen.

        # Do This

        This animation already is updating one sprite's x property to make it look like it's shaking

        -   Run the program to see how it works.
        -   Edit the code in this program to make the second sprite shake like the first one.
        -   Move on when your program looks like the picture to the right.

        This program has already created 4 functions that draw parts of a scene. Unfortunately it's not coming out right.

        -   **Read the 4 functions** to know what they do
        -   **Call the functions** in an order that draws the scene in the way that looks best to you

        # Making Changes to Functions

        A nice benefit of using functions to remove repeated code is that you can now easily make changes to multiple places in your code. Just change how you create the functions, and your program will now use the new code everywhere your function is called.

        # Do This

        Make changes to the `setFlyer` function so that the flyer starts at a random Y location between 0 and 400, and moves at a random velocity every time he is reset.

        -   Add an `if else` statement after you update the position of the bees.
        -   In the input of the if use a boolean to check if the x position of the mouse is on the side of the screen with the flower.

        On the interactions table from your planning sheet, find all of the interactions that rely on user input (key presses and mouse movements). For each of those interactions:

        -   Add an `if` block (or `if-else` block if you need a fallback action) inside the `draw()` loop.
        -   Add the appropriate input block for your condition (such as `keyDown()` or `mouseDown()`).
        -   Add the necessary actions inside the `if` block.

        **Challenge:** Can you create more sophisticated conditionals by nesting them or using compound booleans?

        # Make a Prediction: User Input

        So far you've used `keyDown` as a way to let users control your programs, but that's just one of many ways to take input. In fact, just one of many ways _to detect keypresses_! Depending on how you want to react to a keypress, there are a few other blocks you might want to use.

        Read the program and predict below what will happen when you press each of the up, down, left, and right arrows.

        After making your prediction, run the code and write down or share with your neighbor your observations.

        -   What seems to be the difference between `keyDown()`, `keyWentDown()`, and `keyWentUp()`?
        -   What do you think the exclamation mark (`!`) on line 10 does?
        -   How might you use the different keypress blocks in a game?

        # Mouse X and Y

        One of the simplest ways to take input is to just make a sprite follow the user's mouse position. **You can get the x and y location of the mouse using `World.mouseX` and `World.mouseY`.**  This follows the pattern you learned with sprite properties. `World` is the name of the object. `mouseX` and `mouseY` are the names of the properties.

        You are going to make a bee sprite follow the mouse around the game area.

        -   The bee image is already loaded in the animation tab for you.
        -   Create a bee sprite that draws in the center of the window.
        -   Inside the draw loop update the position of the sprite to the position of the mouse:
            -   Set the x position of the sprite to the value of `World.mouseX`.

        Using the counter pattern and sprite properties, make an animation all your own. You might consider building on the static images you've made in the past, or come up with a new image to create or story to tell.

        # Do This

        To start, let's just get a static scene set up.

        -   Add images in the Animation Tab.
        -   Create sprites and assign images.
        -   Set up the draw loop to draw a background and your sprites.
      CSD U3 Movement Your Own 2: |-
        # Add movement to your animation

        With your static scene set up, you can now add some movement. When you are satisfied with your program, click the "Submit" button to turn it in. You can always unsubmit and continue working if you want to add features.

        # Do This

        In the draw loop

        -   Identify which sprite properties to change.
        -   Update those properties using the counter pattern.

        _Tip: If your counter pattern isn't working like you expect, add watchers to help debug your program._

        Make your program animate like the image to the right. Update `fly.x` inside the draw loop so that in each frame the fly is drawn a little bit further to the left.

        _Tip: You can make your sprites move faster by adding or subtracting larger numbers. The fly in our example moves about twice as fast as the plane in the last level._

        Now, you can use `rotationSpeed` to make your sprites rotate by a certain amount each time they are drawn. If you want your sun to rotate by two degrees each time it's drawn, you can use `sun.rotationSpeed = 2` before the draw loop, after you create your sprite.

        # Bounciness

        So far, `bounceOff` has made sprites bounce away from other objects as fast as they bounced into them.  In the real world, almost everything slows down just a little bit when it bounces off something else.  You can use the `bounciness` block to tell your sprite how much to slow down or speed up when it bounces off something else.

        # Do This

        -   Read the code below and press "Run" to see the behavior of the basketball and pool ball.
        -   Use a `bounciness` block to set the bounciness of your soccer ball.
        -   Run the code again to see how the sprites bounce off the floor.

        When the apple hits the blender, the blender should turn on.

        Use the `isTouching` block to make the blender shake back and forth when the apple sprite touches the blender sprite.  The shaking motion is already coded using the random block, so you just have to check when the two sprites are touching.

        Add an obstacle sprite to the game. You can use whatever image you like from the animation tab but the example shown here uses a sun. Right now you just need to add the sprite to your game and give it an animation.

        -   Add a new sprite to your game called "obstacle".
        -   In the animation tab create a new animation for your obstacle. In the example a sun image was chosen.
        -   Use the `sprite.setAnimation()` block to give your sprite the image you chose.
        -   Run the code and make sure the sprite appears where you want it on the screen. You may need to set its X, Y, and scale properties to get it to look the way you want.

        # isTouching()

        Writing out the math each time you want to check whether two sprites are touching can take a while, so a programmer created the `isTouching` block, which can check whether one sprite is touching another sprite (the _target_).  The computer is still doing the same math as in the previous program, but you don't have to worry about it because another programmer already did that work.

        # Do This

        Inside the draw loop, drag the `isTouching` block into the `if` block.     ( [Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered) )

        _Hint: Don't forget to change the "sprite" to "balloon" and the "target" to "tack"._

        # Sprite Interactions

        So far you've been able to create simple sprite interactions by using the `sprite.isTouching()` block. For example, you've reset a coin to a different location on the screen when a character touches it. Now it's time to start making sprites have more complex interactions.

        # Do This

        -   Run the program and observe the interaction between the two sprites.
        -   Discuss with a neighbor: Using only the commands you already know how could you create this kind of interaction? There are many ways to do it, but here are some blocks to consider:
            -   `sprite.isTouching()`
            -   `sprite.velocityX`

        # Collision Types

        There are four types of collisions that we use in Game Lab.  These blocks will cause a certain type of interaction between the _sprite_ and its _target_.

        ## displace

        The `displace` block causes the sprite to push the target as long as they are touching each other. The sprite keeps moving normally.

        ## collide

        The `collide` block makes the sprite stop when it runs into the target.  If the target is moving, it will push the sprite with it.  The target keeps moving normally.

        ## bounce

        The `bounce` block makes the sprite and the target bounce when they touch each other.  Both the sprite and the target change how they are moving.

        ## bounceOff

        The `bounceOff` block makes the sprite bounce off the target.  The target keeps moving normally.

        # Changing Sprites

        You saw on the last level that `keyDown` returns `true` while you are holding a key down and `false` when the key is not pressed down.   The input for the `keyDown` command is the name of key you want to check in quotes. Some examples are "x", "up" and "space".

        We can use `keyDown` as an input to an `if` statement to change our animations based on key presses!

        # Do This

        -   Run the code and try pressing the up and down arrows.
        -   Look inside the `if` statement to see how the code works.
        -   Add a block inside the third `if` statement to change the animation to a different animal.

        Making a second platform will be easier than making the first, because you can copy and paste a lot of the code, then make a few small changes.  This is a lot easier in _text mode_, so be sure to try it out if you haven't already.

        # Do This

        -   Copy the code you used to create the first platform sprite (`createSprite`, `setAnimation`, and `velocityY`), and paste it directly beneath the original code.
        -   Change the names of the sprite in the new lines.  For example, if you named your original sprite "platform", you could name this one "platform2".

        -   Drag it out and position it on the screen
        -   Change the id to something meaningful
        -   Read through the properties and experiment with them

        When you only had four bits, the highest number that you could make was fifteen.  Now you'll have a chance to work with more bits to make higher numbers.

        In this activity, the dots are replaced with numbers, but you still add up everything that's showing to see what number the binary code stands for.  The left-most bit doesn't have a number yet, so you'll have to give it one.

        # Do This

        -   Click on the bits to turn them on and off, and see the different numbers you can make.
        -   With your partner, discuss the pattern in the numbers.  Decide what number you think should go in the left most box.
        -   Click "Edit" to change the value of the left most bit.

        # Limiting Turn

        You might have noticed that it was really hard to steer the car unless your hands were moving slowly and carefully. This is because the number that `roll` returns can be a really big number depending on how much the accelerometer is being turned. Remember, `roll` has a range from -90 to 90.

        # Do This

        Find a way to make `roll` a smaller number while still using it to steer the car. You have all of the math operators available to you for this.

        _Challenge_: Can you keep the car from going off the side of the screen?

        # Steering Wheel

        This game is similar to the goalie game that you just played, except a little different. Use your board as a steering wheel for the car (moving side to side). You have to get to the checkered flag at while avoiding the red flags along the way!

        -   Make the car move down the screen while the program runs.
        -   Give the car the ability to steer side to side.

It's easy to display the raw numbers coming out of a sensor, but far more interesting to present that data in different ways.

        Consider the following ways you might communicate sensor data:

        -   Use the board outputs
        -   Change the width, height, or position of a UI element
        -   Use conditionals to display different images based on sensor values

        # Displaying Sensor Readings in Color

        In the earlier prediction level you saw how the `setScale()` method can convert the full range of sensor readings (0-1023) into a range that can be used for RGB values (0-255). Let's build on that idea to make an app that can communicate the current value of all three analog sensors with a single color.

        # Do This

        To start, we just need to set the sensor scales correctly - don't worry about actually setting the color of the background yet.

        -   Using the `sensor.setScale()` block, set each of light and sound sensors to the right scale for an RGB color channel.
        -   Create a variable for each of the three colors and assign each one to the value of a different sensor.
        -   Use `console.log()` to test that your variables are in the correct range.

        _Hint: Order matters. You need to set the scale of a sensor before checking its value_

        _Hint: Remember that the temperature sensor can be read in both Celsius and Fahrenheit - either way it should already give you a value that's within the necessary range for RGB_

        # Change Threshold

        By default a sensor's "change" event fires every time the sensor value changes at all, even by one. The light and sound sensors are constantly fluctuating, so you probably want the "change" event to be a little less responsive. The `threshold` property allows you to set how much a sensor should change before considering it a "change" event - so setting `soundSensor.threshold = 100` would cause the sound sensor's "change" event only to trigger if its value increased or decreased by at least 100.

        # Do This

        This app changes the background color of the screen whenever the sound sensor value changes, but we want to only respond to big changes in volume (like a loud noise). Use the `soundSensor.threshold` block to fix it.

        -   Add a `soundSensor.threshold` block before the event handler
        -   Test out which how different threshold values impact the "change" event
        -   Choose a threshold value that makes the screen background change only when a loud noise is sensed.

        _Tip: Your threshold depends on how much ambient noise there is in the room, and how much it changes. A threshold that works in a quiet room may not work in a louder classroom._

        # Make Your Own Buttons

        Similar to LEDs, buttons are a really simple circuit that you can add to your board pretty easily. Like LEDs, buttons should be wired from a numbered pin to a ground pin, but unlike LEDs, a button circuit should be disconnected in the middle. When you connect the circuit, it will produce a button press event.

        # Do This

        -   Grab two wires.
        -   Connect one wire to an open numbered pin.
        -   Connect the second wire to a ground pin.
        -   Update line 2 so that it's referencing the pin you chose.
        -   Run the provided code.
        -   With the program running, touch the unconnected ends of both wires together to "press" the button.

        _Tip: A button circuit can be made with many different kinds of materials, as long as they are electrically conductive. Try making buttons with foil, silverware, or paper clips._

        You might have noticed that the new blocks we're using are in a different toolbox drawer. The **Circuit** drawer contains all of the board objects that are built into the Circuit Playground, but when you start wiring your own circuits the Maker Toolkit no longer knows where everything is.

In addition to the `pinMode()` and `digitalWrite()` commands you've seen, it includes commands to create new objects on the board that can be programmed in the same way as the blocks in the **Circuit** drawer. The `var myLed = createLed()` command, for example, creates a new LED object that behaves just like the `led` blocks you've been using.

        Now that you're creating new board objects that we don't have blocks for, you'll need to work in text mode. You can still drag out blocks that you're familiar with from the **Circuit** drawer, you'll just need to change the name of the object.

        -   Using another wire, connect the negative (-) side of the LED to a ground (GND) pin (it doesn't matter which one)
        -   Run this program to test your circuit. If it worked, your LED should turn on.

        _Debugging Tip: LEDs only work if the electricity is flowing from positive to negative. If your LED doesn't light up, make sure that it's oriented the right way._

        -   Change the parameter name from `n` to `color`
        -   Inside your function, add a _for loop_ that repeats until it reaches the end of `colorLeds`
        -   Inside your _for loop_, set the color of the current led to the parameter `color` (eg. `colorLeds[i].color(color)`

        We'll add event handlers that use this function in the next level, but for now you can test your function by your program and typing this into the debug console: `setLedsColor("blue")`

        # Switching Colors with a Function

        We could write a for loop for each different color that we want to set LEDs to, but that would be a lot of duplicate code that's _almost_ the same. This is the perfect place to use a _function with a parameter_! You've seen and used functions with parameters before, but now you're going to make one from scratch.

        # Do This

        Create a function called `setLedsColor` that takes a parameter `color` and uses it to change the color of all of the LEDs

        -   At the bottom of your program, drag out a function with parameter block ![expandable](https://images.code.org/bd6ec3d9a651cf760a7dc8e1949658c0-image-1512761901850.png)
        -   Change the name from `myFunction` to `setLedsColor`
        -   Change the parameter name from `n` to `color`
        -   Inside your function, add a _for loop_ that repeats until it reaches the end of `colorLeds`
        -   Inside your _for loop_, set the color of the current led to the parameter `color` (eg. `colorLeds[i].color(color)`

        We'll add event handlers that use this function in the next level, but for now you can test your function by your program and typing this into the debug console: `setLedsColor("blue")`

        Design elements have a property called "hidden" that controls whether the element should show on screen or not. We are going to use this property to create an alarm app. Notice that when the program starts one button is hidden, and one is not.

        -   Change the "text" property of "statusLabel" to "on"

        The last function that you need to figure out is the `checkWin()` function, which after each player is moved, and is used to both check if that player has made it to the bottom of the screen and to announce the winner if necessary. For now, we're just going to find out where the player is and log it to the console.

        # Do This

        Just like the `movePlayer()` function, `checkWin()` takes a single parameter called `player`. If you call `checkWin("red")`, then the variable `player` will have the value "red".

        -   Find where the function is defined ( [Show me where](#triggercallout=block_trigger) )
        -   Create a variable called `player_y` and assign it the "y" property of the player
        -   Use either a `console.log()` command or a watcher to report the value of `player_y`

        # The checkWin() Function

        The last function that you need to figure out is the `checkWin()` function, which after each player is moved, and is used to both check if that player has made it to the bottom of the screen and to announce the winner if necessary. For now, we're just going to find out where the player is and log it to the console.

        # Do This

        Just like the `movePlayer()` function, `checkWin()` takes a single parameter called `player`. If you call `checkWin("red")`, then the variable `player` will have the value "red".

        -   Find where the function is defined ( [Show me where](#triggercallout=block_trigger) )
        -   Create a variable called `player_y` and assign it the "y" property of the player
        -   Use either a `console.log()` command or a watcher to report the value of `player_y`
        -   Play the game with only one button, keeping an eye on the value of `player_y`

        # Activate Your Button

        In the last lesson you focused on laying out a page of your app in Design Mode. This is a great, quick way to get the visual side of an app figured out, but it's not very functional. If you click any of the buttons you added, nothing happens. Now you're work towards adding some basic functionality by making the buttons in your app actually _do_ something!

        **Goal:** Add code using Design Mode to make the button respond to a click.

        # Do This

        Your starter app has two elements, a _label_ with the id `titleLabel` and a _button_ with the id `changeTitleButton`. To start with, you're going to make the button log a message to the console when it's clicked.

        -   In Design Mode, **click on the provided button to edit its properties**
        -   Click on the **Events** tab
        -   Insert an `onEvent` from Design Mode by clicking **Insert and show code** under the **Events Tab**.
        -   Take a look at the block that was added to the **Code Mode** tab.
        -   Run the program, click your button and **look for the output in the _Debug Console_** below the workspace instead of the app window. We will discuss the _Debug Console_ on the next level.

        Here we have a couple buttons with event handlers and `console.log` statements, but they are all switched around!

        We should have given the buttons better ID names so we could tell the difference based on the ID. **Can you update the ID names and `console.log` messages to match the correct button?**

        # Do This

        -   **Change the IDs** of the buttons in Design Mode to more descriptive names.

        -   Switch to Code Mode and notice that the **ID pulldowns have been updated to include the new IDs**. (You still need to select the correct ID from the pulldown menu.)

        # How Do Events Work?

        Event-driven apps are made up of elements that can trigger events (such as buttons) and pieces of code called **event handlers**. Event handlers are commands that "watch" for certain events to occur in your program, and then run some function when an event occurs.

        When you first create an event handler from Design Mode, puts a `console.log()` block inside to help you test the event, but you can put just about any code you want inside the event hander.

        # Do This

        The toolbox has a new block called `setText` which allows you to change the text of an element on the screen. You're going to modify the button event handler so that it changes the title text when clicked.

        -   Drag out a `setText()` block to the _inside_ of the `onEvent()` callback function (where the `console.log()` block currently is)
        -   From the block's dropdown, select "titleLabel" (the id of the element you want to change)
        -   In the block's second input, replace "text" with a new title for the app
        -   Run your program and click the button to see it work
      CSDU4 - Design Mode - 4: |-
        # IDs

        The `id` (we'll typically write **ID**) is a **unique identifier** used for each element in the app.

        Each element that appears in the app must have a **unique ID**. In fact, if you try to run a program that has two buttons with same ID you will get a warning message in the console.

        # Do This

        While each element you drag out in Design Mode gets a default ID, they aren't really that helpful (like `button1` and `button2`), so you should get in the habit of creating your own IDs.

        -   Change the ID of your "click me" button to something useful (like `redButton`)
        -   Drag out a second button
        -   Make the second button blue and give it an ID of `blueButton`

        # Navigating

        Once you start adding multiple screens to an app, you need to make sure that users can always get where they want to go. In the next two levels you'll learn how to make sure a user can always get back to the "homepage" of your app.

        # Do This

        Here's an app with four different pages, but only the "red" screen is linked so far. In this level you'll make the other two buttons take the user to the correct screen.

        -   Add two `onEvent()` blocks, one each for the "greenButton" and "blueButton"
        -   Use the `setScreen()` block to make each button switch to the appropriate screen
        -   Test your app to make sure both buttons work. For example, when you click the green button you should go to the green screen.
      CSDU4 Connecting Screens Getting Back: |-
        # Navigating Back

        Someone using your app can now get to each of the red, green, and blue pages, but they can't get back to the homepage. You can add buttons and event handlers of your own to help them do this.

        # Do This

        Create buttons and event handlers to help a user navigate back to the "home" screen

        -   Use Design Mode to create a button inside each of the "red", "green", and "blue" screens. Make sure to give them descriptive IDs.
        -   Back in your code drag in three `onEvent()` blocks, one for each of the three buttons you made.
        -   Inside each `onEvent()` block use the `setScreen()` block that switches back to your "home" screen.
        -   Test your app. You should now be able to navigate back to the home screen from each of the other three.

This app is very similar to the list app, with the main difference being that the list app assumes a single user while this app allows all users to add to the same list and "like" submissions.

        This example uses a list of crowdsourced information for simplicity, but you could display any kind of information in many different formats. A crowdsourcing app could allow users to submit locations for display on a map, images to go into a gallery, or any number of other types of information.

        # Decision Maker

        Similar to the quiz app, a decision tree app asks the user a series of questions. The primary difference between the two is that a decision tree doesn't check for right or wrong answers, but instead attempts to give the user a suggestion or help them make a decision based on their answers.

        This simple decision maker asks only three questions,  but more advanced ones actually take the form of a tree as seen below:

        ![](https://images.code.org/aeadfca116011949855c169905ff89a3-image-1476823699500.png)

        Depending on the user's answer to each question, they're given a different page for the next question. This allows the app to gradually narrow down the decision one question at a time. This type of app can be really useful to help users understand complex processes - for example, you might introduce a recycling program by using a decision tree app to help users figure out which bin to sort items into - first asking what material it's made out of, then whether it is clean or not, and so on.

        -   What are some types of elements that you can add to your app?
      CSDU4 Functionality visible: |-
        # Controlling Visibility

        Earlier in this lesson, when we were proposing ways to simplify the quiz app, we mentioned that it was possible to show or hide design elements with code. App Lab has two functions that let you control the visibility of an element:

        -   `hideElement()` makes the specified element invisible
        -   `showElement()` makes the specified element visible

        # Do This

        The provided app has an image and two buttons.

        -   Attach an event handler to the "Hide" button that hides the image when clicked
        -   Attach an event handler to the "Show" button that shows the image when clicked

        The list manager app allows user to keep track of the state of information and can be modified to serve many different purposes, such as checking in / out loaned items, tracking personal To Dos, or keeping track of where things are in a multi-step process.

        While this example focuses on a single list, more sophisticated list apps could allow the user to create multiple lists, or even move items between lists. This app also only keeps track of the name of an item and whether or not it is "Done," but it could be extended to track and organize any amount of information about the list items.

        # Do This

        For each screen of your app:

        -   Find all of the button IDs

Make sure that you test your work often, using `console.log()` blocks to debug any strange behavior with your app. When you think you've got the whole thing working, compare your app with other members of your group to see if they work the same.

        # Buzzer Duration

        As you've noticed, `buzzer.frequency()` has two parameters: frequency and duration. Both of these take a number as input.

        -   Frequency changes how the buzzer sounds. The bigger the number you give it, the higher the buzzer's sound will be.

        -   Duration determines how long the buzzer is going to play a sound for in milliseconds.

        For right now we're going to focus on duration, the second parameter.

        # Do this

        Try out a few things with duration:

        -   Change the duration of the buzzer to something longer than 100.
        -   Try setting the duration to 0, what happens?

        # Challenge: 2D Arrays

        Arrays can hold all sorts of data, like numbers, strings, and even other arrays. When we put an array inside another, this becomes a 2D array. The `buzzer.playSong()` block can be used to play songs that sound more precise with 2D arrays.

        The structure that you've been using to play notes looks like this:

        `buzzer.playNotes( [array of notes to play] , tempo of the whole song);`

        The main difference with `buzzer.playSong()` is each element inside the `[array of notes to play]`, is an array with two elements: the note you want to play, and the duration of the note. Sometime you'll want a quarter note in your song, other times you'll want a full note, or maybe somewhere in between. A full song might look something like this:

        `buzzer.playSong([
          ["G3",0.25],
          ["C4",0.25],
          ["E4",0.25],
          ["G4",0.125],
          [null,0.375],
          ["E4",0.1875],
          ["G4",1]
        ], 120);`

        # Do this

        -   Use the `buzzer.playSong` block to make a different song.
        -   When you get comfortable with the structure, add more notes to the song.

      CSDU6 play null notes: |-
        # Null Notes

        You may have noticed that if you put the same note side-by-side in the array, the buzzer just plays that note as one long sound instead of as individual notes. In music we often want a break (or _rest_) between notes. You can get your buzzer to play a rest by sending it the value `null`.

        `null` is a special value that represents emptiness in computer science. `playNotes` plays each note for the same duration, so a `null` element in the array is just telling `playNotes` to play nothing for the same duration as everything else.

        # Do this

        -   Run the code to hear what it sounds like first.
        -   Examine the array inside `buzzer.playNotes()`.
        -   Put a pause between notes that are the same and side-by-side, and any other place you deem appropriate.

        # Break a random substitution cipher!

        Messages encrypted with the **Caesar cipher** are very easy to crack. What if instead of shifting the whole alphabet, we mapped every letter of the alphabet to a random different letter of the alphabet? This is called a **random substitution cipher**.

        In this version of the tool, you'll be interacting more with the graphs that show letter frequency. By analyzing the frequency of the letters in the encrypted input message compared to the frequency of letters in a typical piece of English prose, you can start to narrow in on what some of the letter mappings might be. Did you know that _'E'_ is the most common letter used in the English language? Maybe the most common letter in your encrypted text maps to the letter _'E'_, but maybe not! You'll have to do a bit of guess and check to see if that substitution makes sense.

        # Do this

        -   Load the **Sample message (hard)** from the message dropdown. This will load a message that has been encrypted with a random substitution cipher.\

        -   You will crack the message by guessing what each letter of the alphabet contained in the original ciphertext should be changed to. You can do so by dragging the blue letters of the alphabet directly underneath the orange letter you want changed in the original ciphertext. Letters that have been changed using your guesses will no longer be highlighted orange in the message window on the left.

        -   Play with some of the sorting options available in the Random substitution cipher tab to get different views on the letter frequencies in the input text as well as standard English text.

      Gamelab StartScreen Change State: |-
        # Changing the State

        Now that you can display a different screen according to the state of your program, you will need a way to change between states.  To go from the "starting" state to the "playing" state, you can have the user press the "s" key.  You'll **only** want the program to check for the key press when the program is in the "starting" state, so your code for this will go inside the "starting" conditional.  Putting one `if` block inside another is called **nesting** conditionals.

        ## Do this

        -   Inside the `if` statement that checks for "starting", add in a new `if` statement that checks whether the user has pressed the "s" key.  (`if (keyDown("s")) {`)
        -   Inside your new `if` statement, set the value of your `gameState` variable to "playing". (`gameState = "playing";`)
        -   Test the code by starting the game and pressing "s".  The game should start playing after the key is pressed.

        If the game isn't starting on the start screen, double check that when the `gameState` variable is created at the beginning of the program, its value is "starting".  (`var gameState = "starting";`)
      Gamelab StartScreen Check State: |-
        # Checking Game State

        Now that you have your game state stored in a variable, you can check it to determine what should be displayed.  This should happen inside the draw loop, since it's something that will change as the program is being run.  The program should check whether the game is in the "playing" state, and only run the program if it is.  We can worry about the other states later.

        ## Do This

        -   Inside the draw loop, add a conditional (`if` statement).
        -   For the condition, check if `gameState == "playing"`.
        -   Move the rest of the code from the draw loop inside the `if` statement, so it only runs if the game is "playing".
        -   Run the program.  Nothing should happen because the game is still in the "starting" state.
        -   Go back to where you set the value of your `gameState` variable and change it from "starting" to "playing".
        -   Run the game again, and it should play normally, because it is now in the "playing" state.
        -   Change the value of the variable back to "starting".

        (It is important to find ways to check your code as you go, rather than wait until the end of many complex changes to run it.  By checking both the playing and starting states, you know that your conditional is working properly and that the game should play while in the "playing" state.)
      Gamelab StartScreen Check States: |-
        # Check all States

        Right now the only state your program can deal with is "playing", but you can add more conditionals to account for the other three states.

        ## Do this

        -   Inside the draw loop, add in three more `if` statements that check for `gameState == "starting"`, `gameState == "won"`, and `gameState == "lost"`, respectively.
        -   Inside each `if` statement, add code that will draw text to the screen, so you can see the results of the different states.  You may also want to use `drawSprites` so you can see the background image and the player sprites, but make sure you are drawing the text on top of the sprites.
        -   Check your code by running the program in the different states.  (Don't worry about making them perfect yet, just make sure that the conditionals are working as they should.)

        In order to keep track of your code, you might find it useful to create a function for each of the different text displays, then call those functions inside the conditionals.
      Gamelab StartScreen End Game: |-
        # Ending the Game

        Next, you'll need to add code that changes the state of the game when you lose.   Scroll down to the bottom of the program, to the `gameStatus` function.  Inside the function, the program checks the score and lives variables to check whether the use should win or lose the game.  Instead of displaying a win or lose message, you'll want to change the state of the game to "won" or "lost";

        ## Do this

        -   Inside the `gameStatus` function, replace the code `text("You Won!", 35, 200);` with `gameState = "won"`.
        -   Inside the `gameStatus` function, replace the code `text("You Lost!", 35, 200);` with `gameState = "lost"`.
        -   Check your code by running the game and losing.
        -   Check your code by running the game and winning.

        (To make the game much easier to win, change the original number of lives to 1000 by replacing `var lives = 3;` to `var lives = 1000;`.)
      Gamelab StartScreen Hide Sprites: |-
        # Hide and Show Sprites

        You may prefer that the platform, coin, and rock sprites only be visible when the game is playing.  You can change the game setup to set their visible property to `false` at the beginning of the game, then set it to `true` when you start the game, then `false` again when the game is won or lost.

        ## Do this

        -   Add code after you create your platforms, gold, and rocks sprite groups that sets those sprite groups' visible properties to `false` (e.g. `platforms.setVisibileEach(false);` )
        -   In the same  three places where you set `gameState = "playing";`, set the sprite groups' visible properties to `true`.
        -   In the same places where you set `gameState = "lost";` and `gameState = "won";`, set the sprite groups' visible
        -   Check your code by running the game and losing and restarting the game.
        -   Check your code by running the game and winning and restarting the game.

        # Start and End Screens

        This tutorial will teach you how to make start and end screens in Game Lab, as well as restart the game from the end screen.

        Hit run to play the game on the left.  Follow the instructions on the start screen to play.  Once the game is over, follow the instructions on the end screen to restart the game.

        In the next bubble, you'll see the code for game play and start to add your own start and end screens.

        ## Start Screen

        The start screen is the introductory screen that appears before the user starts playing the game.  It usually has the title of the game and some basic instructions for playing.  It might also include the game developer.

        ## End Screen

        The end screen appears after the user has won or lost the game.  It sometimes includes the final score, player rankings or other information.  It can also have an option to play the game again.
      Gamelab StartScreen Restart Game: |-
        # Restarting the Game

        Last, you'll need to add code that restarts the game.   This is similar to how you started the game by having the user press the "s" key.  This time, you'll need to check during the "lost" and "won" states.  If the user presses the "r" key during on of these states, you should restart the game by setting the `gameState` to "playing" and also resetting the `score` and `lives` variables to 0 and 3, respectively.

        ## Do this

        -   Inside the `if (gameState == "lost") {` statement, add an if statement that checks whether the user has pressed the "r" key.
        -   Inside your new `if` statement, set `score` to 0, `lives` to 3, and `gameState` to "playing".
        -   Inside the `if (gameState == "won") {` statement, add an if statement that checks whether the user has pressed the "r" key.
        -   Inside your new `if` statement, set `score` to 0, `lives` to 3, and `gameState` to "playing".
        -   Inside the `gameStatus` function, replace the code `text("You Lost!", 35, 200);` with `gameState = "lost"`.
        -   Check your code by running the game and losing and restarting the game.
        -   Check your code by running the game and winning and restarting the game.
      Gamelab StartScreen State: |-
        # Game State Variable

        Our sample game had four different scenarios (or **states**) that we need to keep track of in order to display the right screen: "starting", "playing", "won", and "lost".  The first step in adding a start or end screen to the game is creating a variable to keep track of any changes in the state of the game.

        ## Do This

        -   Declare a variable called `gameState` at the beginning of the program.  (A good place to do this would be near where `score` and `lives` are declared.
        -   Set the initial value of  your `gameState` variable to "starting"

        (Because you are not using this variable yet, you will see a warning triangle next to the line where it is declared.  It also will not affect how the program runs.)
      Gamelab StartScreen base code: |-
        # Game Code

        This is the code for the game without the start and end screens.  The function `gameStatus` (called on line 43 and defined on line 208) checks whether the user has won or lost, but it only adds a text message to the screen.  Gameplay also continues even after the game is over.

        ## Do This

        Read the code, in particular the code before the draw loop (lines 1-24), inside the draw loop (lines 27-43), and inside the `gameStatus` function (lines 209-224).  It's okay if you don't understand everything in the game, but you should see that the code before the draw loop sets up the sprites, and the code inside the draw loop controls the gameplay.

        Watch this video that defines "events" and shows how they work in CS Fundamentals. Afterwards, you will try some puzzles that require you to code events.

        > An event is a line of code that tells your computer to "listen" for something to happen, then take an action. For example, on web pages, you often can display a drop down menu when you roll over the navigation bar with your mouse. The "mouse rollover" is an "event" that triggers an action.

        # Best Practices > Meta-Cognitive Problem Solving

        Explicitly teaching meta-cognitive problem solving strategies before, during and after coding is extremely important in helping students process their learning. Mega-cognitive problem solving involves thinking about your thought process itself, and reflecting on _how_ you solve problems. Watch the video below to learn about Code.org's "Puzzle Solving Recipe" that can help students have success with difficult problems:

        [This worksheet](http://code.org/curriculum/docs/k-5/PuzzleSolvingStudent.png) details the different steps of the Puzzle Solving Recipe.

        ## Looking Ahead > Getting "Unplugged"

        <img src="https://images.code.org/ae83fdee9390a1155e5173b2a06f9773-image-1434399991310.JPG" class="level-image">

        In teaching computer science, you might think it would be best to have access to top tier technology -- new computers, fast Internet, the latest apps. But at Code.org, we've found that some of the most impactful computer science lessons are actually "unplugged," or conducted with little to no technology at all. In these lessons, students learn computer concepts without a computer.

        That's why all of our CS Fundamentals courses use unplugged activities to introduce computer science concepts with physical manipulatives before students write computer programs using those concepts. An example of this would be doing a dance of repeated movements with the class to understand the concept of how loops repeat commands in a computer program. This way when the students go on to writing programs using loops, the unplugged activity has set them up with something they are already familiar with and they can relate this new concept back to that activity.

        Watch the video below to understand the benefits of using unplugged activities to teach computer science.

        **As you work your way through Stages 4-8**, you'll have a chance to review some of our unplugged activities for each of the core concepts covered in this course.

        science away from the computer! However, we've found that some of the most

        activities to introduce computer science concepts with physical manipulatives
        before students write computer programs using those concepts. We also use
        unplugged activities to teach important concepts that are not coding, like

        In order to make your room escape you will need to set up the room the user will be able to adventure around in. Some of the work has already been done for you.  You just need to decide what the different parts of the room will look like by picking pictures!

        # Do This

        -   The level starts in Design Mode
        -   For each image element that is blank (gray rectangle) add an appropriate image. For example you will need a door image for the image element labeled door.
        -   An example of what the room might look like are on the right.

            -   Add an if statement
            -   In the if statement add the `==`
            -   On one side of the `==` put the x position you move the key to when it is clicked
            -   On the other side add the `getXPosition()` block - The ID for that should be the ID of your key!

      Standalone_Artist_3: Can you draw this hexagon with 100 pixel sides and 60 degree
        turns?
      Standalone_Artist_4: Now you've got a new block to play with, the loop. This
        will repeat a set of commands. What happens if you loop these commands 6 times?
      Standalone_Artist_5: How many times do you need to loop this diamond to draw
        the flower?
      Standalone_Artist_5.5: 'Notice how we simplified the diamond code by turning
        it into a loop. You can loop that whole sequence 12 times to draw the flower.

        keep drawing over the same diamond.'
      Standalone_Artist_6: 'Loop this hexagon code 6 times to create the design. How

      Standalone_Artist_8: Here's a function called `Draw a shape` that we've programmed
        to draw hexagons. Run the code to see what it does and then experiment with
        the function to see what happens. Can you make it draw a pattern of squares,
        triangles, or octagons?
