      4-5 Artist Patterns 2: If you place your square loop inside another loop, we
        call that a nested loop. What do you need to add as an outer loop to make
        sure all 15 squares line up next to each other?
      4-5 Artist Patterns 3: Now let's go one level deeper! We've nested that whole
        block of code into another loop, but you need to get the artist back in place
        to draw the next line. Which of these code blocks can you place at the end
        of the outermost loop to draw the whole grid?

      Course 4 Artist Vars 1: "Let's draw an equilateral triangle. \n\nIt has to be
        exactly 100 pixels long on each side."
      Course 4 Artist Vars 11: Here’s more complicated code using the same concepts
        from the last puzzle - what should you set the "sides" variable to in order
        to draw this picture made of squares?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 12: Let's set the "sides" variable to 5. The more sides
        we add to this algorithm, the bigger this whole pattern gets! Notice that
        there is another variable called "length". We can now use that wherever we
        have a "move forward." Set the "length" variable to 75 for this shape.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 13: "When a shape has lots of sides, each side needs to
        be shorter if you want the whole pattern to fit on the screen. \nLet's recreate
        the algorithm for this amazing pattern, but instead of manually setting the
        `length` variable, let's use a math block with the `sides` variable inside
        to make sure that each shape fits correctly. The perimeter of each polygon
        is 300 pixels.\nNeed some hints?  Click here."

        Free Play: Check it out! Now your algorithm is nested within one more loop. Experiment with changing the values of your two variables to draw cool patterns.

        For even more effect, try playing with color!  Use random colors inside loops to see how it changes your design.
      Course 4 Artist Vars 2: Instead of using "move forward by 150," the "move" block
        is now referencing a variable called "length." Can you set "length" to 150
        to draw this new triangle?
      Course 4 Artist Vars 4: Now I want to make a rectangle that is twice as tall
        as it is wide. We've got a variable called "width" that needs to be set to
        100. Can you use the math blocks to complete the code?

        Here’s some code that can draw any regular polygon. There’s a new variable called sides that is set to 4. Can you use the sides variable (along with the math block) to turn the right amount regardless of how many sides there are in the polygon?

        stays the same, no matter how many sides it has? Hint: If you divide your

      Course 4 Bee 1: "The bee can't tell what's under the cloud! \n\nUse the `if`
        block to check whether there is a flower under the cloud. \n\nGet nectar one
        time, ONLY if there is a flower."
      Course 4 Bee 2: Use the "if/else" block to check each object to see if it's
        a flower or a honeycomb . If it's a flower, collect one nectar...otherwise,
        make one honey!
      Course 4 Bee 3: The unknown object is either a flower or a honeycomb. This time,
        use the if/else block to collect one nectar if it is a flower, else make one
        honey (because then it would be a honeycomb).
      Course 4 Bee Loops 5 NEW: Here are three flowers. Can you find the pattern of
        instructions that you need to repeat 3 times to collect the nectar with the
        fewest number of blocks?

        on its way to the honeycomb with as few blocks as possible.  When you get
        there, don't forget to make honey!
      Course 4 Bee Params 1: Write a sequence to collect all of the nectar using `get
        3 nectar` which turns, moves to collect the nectar, and then returns to the
        original location.

        jump heights.  \n\nWe need to add a parameter to our jump function called
        \"height\".  The up arrow should cause the dog to jump 200 pixels and the
        down arrow should make it jump only 100 pixels. "
      Course 4 Play Lab Params 3: 'We have added another parameter to the jump function
        so that we can use it with other actors. Each actor is represented by a number,

      Course 4 Play Lab Params 8: Use the `when actor touches` block to send Dog back

        "Run" to play the game! In this game, you're the dog who is trying to collect
        more flags than the cat. Use the down arrow to control the dog. Press "Finish"

      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 2: The race in that last puzzle wasn't very fair! Change
        the `dog_speed` variable to make sure you can collect more flags than Cat.
        The first to collect 10 flags wins!
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 3: Use the left and right arrows to move, and the up
        arrow to jump. See if you can collect all of the flags.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 4: Now we're using a variable called "height" to control
        how high the dog can jump. Update the "height" variable so that the dog can
        jump high enough to reach all the flags.

        In our game, how should we score points? Add 1 to your "points" variable each time Dog hits Cat with a piece of pie. Use the "when actor 2 touches anything" event to trigger an update to your score. You can increment your variable by setting "points = points + 1." Get your score up to 10 (going one at a time!) to pass the level.
      Course 4 Play Lab Vars 7: Nice, now let's make sure this game isn't too easy
        to play. Any time Dog (actor 1) gets hit by a sandwich from Cat (actor 2),
        you should lose a point. Start with 10 points so it's not too hard. Let your
        score drop down from 10 to 0 to pass the level.
