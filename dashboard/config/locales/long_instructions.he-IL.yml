        ## Questions to consider

        -   How did you follow the problem solving process in the last lesson?
        -   How could you use this process on a problem in your everyday life?

        # 3 Bit Colors

        Each pixel is a square on a screen that emits light. Each pixel can have a certain number of bits assigned to it, and bits per pixel determine the colors that can be rendered.

        In this tool we're using 3 bits to define the one large black pixel. The first bit affects the red tint. The second bit affects the green tint. The third bit affects the blue tint.

        # Do This

        -   Click the "Run" button to start the widget
        -   Click on the light bulbs to turn on or off each color and see what happens to your pixel
        -   See how many different colors you can create with just three bits
        -   Write down the binary associated with each color you come up with
      CSD U1 - PixFilter Filter Intro: |-
        # Filtering Pixels

        If you've ever used Instagram you've probably encountered an image filter. Image filters read in each pixel, process it in some way, and the return the filtered pixel. In this tool we're going to start by filtering just a single pixel before moving on to a full image.

        # Do This

        -   Try changing the color drop downs in the Filter section
        -   Click on the top row of lightbulbs in the Diagram section to see how the filter will convert the input (top bulbs) to the output (bottom bulbs)
        -   Look at how the numbers in the Binary section reflect changes to the colors
        -   Based on how the bits change, can you formulate what replace is doing? Talk to your partner and see if you can figure it out.
        -   Complete the Level 2 table in your Activity Guide
      CSD U1 - PixFilter Filter Revisit: |-
        # Combining Filters

        Now that you've played with filtering a single color channel, it's time to see what happens if we filter more than one color.

        # Do This

        -   Using the color dropdowns in the filter section, build a filter that changes the value of more than one color channel
        -   Click on the top row of lightbulbs in the Diagram section to see how the filter will convert the input (top bulbs) to the output (bottom bulbs)
        -   Look at how the numbers in the Binary section reflect changes to the colors
        -   Complete the Level 4 table in your Activity Guide

        # Combining Filters

        Sometimes you'll need to filter more than one pixel to get the color change that you want.

        # Do This

        Check out Mario, he's lookin' pretty good in his red hat and overalls. Your job it to set up the filter so he looks like Luigi, with a green hat and overalls.

        -   First, determine which bit(s) needs to change in order to the change you want
        -   Once you've figured out which bit needs changing, set the filter dropdown appropriately
        -   After you've got the filter working so that, try to come up with other filters that change _only_ his hat and overalls - how many different clothing colors can you come up with?

        _How many tries did it take you to find the right filter?_
      CSD U1 - PixFilter Mushroom: |-
        # Filtering Images

        Now that we've seen how a single pixel can be filtered to change its color, let's try applying a filter to an image made of multiple pixels. The filter you create will be applied to each pixel in the image - and you still have the light bulbs available to experiment with how your filter will work with individual colors.

        # Do This

        Here's a picture of a red mushroom - you're going to try and turn it into a yellow mushroom.

        -   First, determine which bit needs to change in order to turn red into yellow
        -   Once you've figured out which bit needs changing, use the filter dropdowns to make all of the red areas turn yellow
        -   After you've got the filter working so that the red has turned yellow, see if you can come up with filters that turn the mushroom other colors

        _How many tries did it take you to find the right filter?_
      CSD U1 - PixFilter UnFilter: |-
        # UnFiltering

        Bit filters can be used to _undo_ filtering as well. Here's an image of a bird that's been filtered from it's original colors. Can you get it back to normal?

        # Do This

        <img src="https://images.code.org/c15636bda16e8792c59ac955332e37a5-image-1471372091393.22.56.png" style="float:right; width: 200px"/>
        Here's what our bird should look like. Use the filter to get him back to normal.

        -   Decide which colors (and so which bits) you need to change. You might need to write your thoughts with pencil and paper.
        -   Once you know which bits need changing, set the filter dropdown appropriately to test your answer
        -   After you've fixed the image, write down both your process and your final filter in the Level 6 section of your Activity Guide

        _How many tries did it take you to find the right filter?_

        <summary><strong>What is whitespace?</strong>
        </summary>

        Whitespace refers to any character that shows up as a blank space on the screen, such as a space, a tab, or a new line. Whitespace helps separate different parts of the document to make it easier to read.  For example, in HTML code new elements are usually put on a new line, even though it doesn't make any difference in how the page is displayed.

        <summary><strong>What is indentation?</strong>
        </summary>

        Indentation is the placement of text farther to the right, or left, to separate it from surrounding text.  Indentation helps to convey the program's structure.  In HTML, elements that are inside other elements are usually indented.  Here is an example:

        <pre>
           &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is inside the "body" element.&lt;/p&gt;

        </details>
        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is formatting?</strong>
        </summary>

        Formatting is arranging text in a way that makes it easier to understand.  HTML is usually formatted using indentation.  That means that elements that are inside other elements are further to the right in code.  Here is an example:

        <pre>
           &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is inside the "body" element.&lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;/body&gt;

        The way that you write your code can make it easier or harder to find bugs.  If you use **whitespace** and **indentation**, it will make it easier to read and easier to fix.

        # Do This

        HTML is used to add structure to the content of a web page. HTML uses tags
        to specify where certain structures start and end. These tags are sets of
        characters not found in the English language so that the content and structure

        tag not have a closing tag?**]\nAn image tag doesn't need a closing tag because
        there is no text content which must be wrapped in tags. The content that shows
        on the screen is specified through the tags attributes.\n:::\n\n::: details
        [**What is an attribute?**]\n\nAttributes are extra information included in
        a tag.  Attributes have names and values. The name tells what type of information
        is being provided and then the value gives the specific information for that
        tag. \n\nFor example `<img>` tags have two attributes, src and alt. src specifies
        the name of the image file and alt tells the browser in readable text what
        the image is.\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n# Giving Credit\n\nWhen using a Creative
        Commons licensed image, you need to give credit to the original creator (this
        is also called _attribution_). There are lots of ways to provide attribution,
        but the easiest way is to add text below the image that identifies the creator
        and website it came from.\n\n# Do This\n\nIn this page we've already added
        and attributed an image of a frog. Use the Creative Commons search engine
        to find another image of an amphibian. Add your found image to this page,
        along with proper attribution, including:\n\n-   The name of the creator (if
        available)\n-   The website it was found on (e.g. commons.wikimedia.org)\n-
        \  The license it was published under (e.g. CC-BY)"

        # RGB Colors

        All colors, whether they have names or not, can be described by the level of red, green, and blue light it takes to make them.  This is called an RGB value (short for Red-Green-Blue).  You can use the widget on your left to try out different RGB values and see what colors they make.

        -   **Click "Run" to start the widget on the left,** and use the sliders to adjust the levels of red, green, and blue light.
        -   For each of the colors below, match it to its RGB value.

        A) red: 216, green: 191, blue: 216 - rgb(216,191,216)

        <summary><strong>Why do red and green make yellow?</strong></summary>

        When you mix paint, red and green make brown, but RGB color mixing uses light instead of paint, so the colors mix differently.  RGB uses _additive color mixing_.  In additive color mixing, red and green make yellow, red and blue make magenta, and blue and green make cyan.  When you mix the three primary colors together (red, green, and blue), they make white.  You can read more at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color">Wikipedia - Additive Color</a>

        # RGB Colors

        All colors, whether they have names or not, can be described by the level of red, green, and blue light it takes to make them.  This is called an RGB value (short for Red-Green-Blue).  You can use the widget on your left to try out different RGB values and see what colors they make.

        -   **Click "Run" to start the widget on the left,** and use the sliders to adjust the levels of red, green, and blue light.
        -   For each of the colors below, match it to its RGB value.

        A) red: 216, green: 191, blue: 216 - rgb(216,191,216)

        B) red: 255, green: 239, blue: 213 - rgb(255,239,213)

        C) red: 250, green: 128, blue: 114 - rgb(250,128,114)

        D) red: 70, green: 130, blue: 180 - rgb(70, 130, 180)

        E) red: 107, green: 142, blue: 35 - rgb(107,142,35)

        <summary><strong>What is a style sheet?</strong></summary>

        <details>
        <summary><strong>What is CSS?</strong></summary>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        </pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        <summary><strong>What should I name my style sheet?</strong></summary>

        You can name your style sheet anything, but it's better to choose a relevant name, such as "style.css" or "aboutmestyles.css" so that it's clear what the file is.  Your file should always end in the ".css" extension.

        </details>
        <details>
        <summary><strong>How do I rename a file?</strong></summary>

        To rename a file, you can right click (or control click) on the file name and choose the "Rename" option.  This will allow you to type in a new file name.  Clicking on a file name after it is already highlighted will also allow you to rename the file.

        </details>
        <details>
        <summary><strong>How do I add a style sheet to a web page?</strong></summary>

        To add a style sheet to a web page, open up the code for the web page.  Inside the head tag, add the following code `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`.  Then change "style.css" to the name of your style sheet.

        This is your project from before.  In the next level, you'll have a chance to add some different styles to it, but first, you need to add a style sheet, name it, and link it to your html page.

        1.  Create a new style sheet for your project.
        2.  Rename the style sheet file.
        3.  Add your style sheet to your HTML page.

        # Adding a Style Sheet

        This is your project from before.  In the next level, you'll have a chance to add some different styles to it, but first, you need to add a style sheet, name it, and link it to your html page.

        1.  Create a new style sheet for your project.
        2.  Rename the style sheet file.
        3.  Add your style sheet to your HTML page.

        ::: details [**What is a style sheet?**]

        A style sheet is a document that controls how a web page will appear.  External style sheets are separate files that are linked to the HTML page.
        :::

        ::: details [**What is CSS?**]

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

            h2 {
               color: blue;
               font-family: cursive;

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        ::: details [**How do I create a new style sheet?**]
        To create a new style sheet, click on the "Add CSS" button above the code area.
        :::

        ::: details [**What should I name my style sheet?**]
        You can name your style sheet anything, but it's better to choose a relevant name, such as "style.css" or "aboutmestyles.css" so that it's clear what the file is.  Your file should always end in the ".css" extension.

        For the code to work, you need to both create a winter class and add elements to the class.

        The class is created in the style sheet, with the following code.

        <pre>.winter {

        This code creates a class called `winter` and makes everything in the class our winter blue, which has the RGB values of (195,230,255).

        The code that adds a `h5` element to the winter class is `<h5 class="winter">`.  The `class=winter` inside the opening tag adds everything inside the tag to the class.

        A web developer uses classes when some elements should be styled differently than others, even if they are the same tag.  Classes can also be used to give elements that have different tags the same style.

        # Spring Class

        Now that your winter class is ready, you can start on the other seasons.

        -   Find the empty CSS rule-set in the style sheet that gives the spring words their style.
        -   Add two rules, one to give the text your spring color for earlier in the lesson, and another to give the text a different font, font size, or decoration.
        -   Add the spring class to the spring elements in the HTML page.

        For the code to work, you need to both create a spring class and add elements to the class.

        The spring class is already created in the style sheet, but it doesn't have any rules.

        <pre>.spring {
          color: rgb(195,230,255);
        }</pre>

        Look at the rules in the `winter` class for clues to how to make rules for the summer class.

        You will also need to add some elements to the spring class inside your HTML file.

        The code in the HTML file that adds a `h5` element to the winter class is `<h5 class="winter">`.  Use this pattern to add elements to the spring class, too.

        <summary><strong>What is whitespace?</strong></summary>

        Whitespace refers to any character that shows up as a blank space on the screen, such as a space, a tab, or a new line. Whitespace helps separate different parts of the document to make it easier to read.  For example, in HTML code new elements are usually put on a new line, even though it doesn't make any difference in how the page is displayed.

        Indentation is the placement of text farther to the right, or left, to separate it from surrounding text.  Indentation helps to convey the program's structure.  In HTML, elements that are inside other elements are usually indented.  Here is an example:
        <pre>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {

        <summary><strong>What colors can I use in CSS?</strong></summary>

        CSS includes most common color names (red, blue, green, etc.), and many uncommon ones.  You can see a full list of CSS color names at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">W3Schools - HTML Color Names</a>.  You can still use colors that are not included in the named list, but you will need to use their RGB values.

        <summary><strong>How does the code work?</strong></summary>

        Here is the code that is making the image borders:

        <pre>img {
          border-color: saddlebrown;
          border-width: 4px;
          border-style: solid;
          border-radius: 10px;
        }</pre>

        -   `img` is the _selector_.  It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces, in this case, the images.
        -   `border-color: saddlebrown;`,`border-width: 4px;`,`border-style: solid;`, and `border-radius: 10px;` are the rules that make the border.

            <summary><strong>What does the <code>border-style</code> property do?</strong></summary>

        The `border-style` property determines what kind of border (solid, dotted, etc.) the element has.  You can read more about this property at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-style.asp">W3Schools - CSS border-style Property</a>

        <summary><strong>What does the <code>border-radius</code> property do?</strong></summary>

        The `border-radius` property determines the radius of the curves at the corners of the element.  A bigger radius makes a bigger, softer curve, and a smaller radius makes a smaller, sharper curve.  A radius of zero makes a regular corner.

        <summary><strong>What does the <code>float</code> property do?</strong></summary>

        The `float` property makes an element "float", meaning that the elements that come after it all flow around it.  If the `float` value is `left`, the element will float to the left, and the elements after it will show up on its right.  If the `float` value is `right`, the element will float to the right, and the elements after it will show up on its left.

        ::: details [**What does the `float` property do?**]

        The `float` property makes an element "float", meaning that the elements that come after it all flow around it.  If the `float` value is `left`, the element will float to the left, and the elements after it will show up on its right.  If the `float` value is `right`, the element will float to the right, and the elements after it will show up on its left.

        inside the curly braces, in this case, the images.\n-   `width: 250px` is
        the rule that makes the image 250 pixels wide.  It also changes the height
        so that the image does not stretch.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**What does the
        `width` property do?**]\n\nThe `width` property determines how wide the element
        will be.  Most of the time, you will define the width in pixels, which makes
        the element take up an exact amount of space on the screen.  Defining the
        width will also change the height so that the image does not stretch, unless
        you have also defined the height.  You can read more about this property at

        take up an exact amount of space on the screen.  Defining the height will

        [**What does `px` mean / What is a pixel?**]\n\nPixel, which is abbreviated
        `px`, is how elements are measured in CSS.  It’s the size of a single point
        of light on the screen.\n\n:::\n\n::: details [**Why does using a width and
        height rule at the same time sometimes stretch out the image?**]\n\nWhen the
        width of an images changes, the height must change by the same percentage,
        otherwise the image will stretch.  For example, if you double the width of
        an image, you must also double the height, or the image will be stretched
        horizonally.  When you only define the width or the height, the computer will
        automatically change the other property so that the image looks the same.\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n#
        Width and Height\n\n-   Find the property in the style sheet that controls
        the width of the images.\n-   Change the width of the images to be larger
        or smaller.\n-   Create a new rule with a `height` property to control the
        height of the images.\n-   Use the `width` property in the `p` rule-set to
        change the width of your paragraphs."

        Hyperlinks can connect to local web pages or external web pages. To add navigation to your website you will need to add hyperlinks which connect your individual web pages. You can **add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element**.  The text you want to display as the hyperlink goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags. The `<a>` element has an attribute `href` which is the location to link to.  The location of a local page is just the file path for that page. <br> <br>

        For example to link to the unique houses page you would add the following code inside your `<body>` element. <br><br>

        <pre>
        &lt;a href=”houses.html”&gt; Unique Houses &lt;/a&gt;

        A web site should include more than one web page, and they should connect to each other.   Here's an example of a project with multiple pages that are connected by hyperlinks (the blue underlined words that take you to another page when you click on them).

        <summary><strong>What are the two types of lists?</strong>

        <summary><strong>What is an unordered list?</strong>
        </summary>

        An unordered list is just a set of bulleted items.

        An unordered list element has the tag `<ul> </ul>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>U</strong>nordered <strong>L</strong>ist. Each item in the list is marked by a list item element `<li> </li>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>I</strong>tem.  The list item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent element, the unordered list.

        </details>

        <details>
        <summary><strong>How do I make an unordered list?</strong>
        </summary>

        Making an unordered list has two steps: making the list and adding the list items.  To make the unordered list, write the unordered list tags `<ul> </ul>`.  Next, add your list items **inside** the unordered list tags.  To make each list item, use the list item tags `<li> </li>` and write the list item inside the tags.

        It can be helpful to indent your `<li> </li>` tags so it's clear they are contained in the `<ul> </ul>` tags.

        <summary><strong>What is an ordered list?</strong>
        </summary>

        An ordered list is a set of bulleted items which are numbered.

        An ordered list element has the tags `<ol> </ol>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>O</strong>rdered <strong>L</strong>ist. Each item in the list is marked by a list item element `<li> </li>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>I</strong>tem.

Websites usually have the same navigation bar across all of their pages so you can get back and forth between things on the site.

        # Do This

        -   In your home page (index.html), add two hyperlinks at the top of the page, one to your lists page, and one to the home page.
            -   _Even though it might seem strange to link a page to itself, it's less confusing if the navigation bar is exactly the same on every page._
        -   Copy the code for the navigation bar, then add it to the top of your lists page.

        ::: details [**What are hyperlinks?**]

        Hyperlinks can connect to local web pages or external web pages. To add navigation to your website you will need to add hyperlinks which connect your individual web pages. You can **add hyperlinks to your web page using the `<a>` element**.  The text you want to display as the hyperlink goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags. The `<a>` element has an attribute `href` which is the location to link to.  The location of a local page is just the file path for that page.
        <br/><br/>
        For example to link to the unique houses page you would add the following code inside your `<body>` element.

            <a href="houses.html"> Unique Houses </a>

        # Create a Navigation Bar

        Here's your project from before.  You'll be linking the two pages by creating a **navigation bar** at the top of the page.  Websites usually have the same navigation bar across all of their pages so you can get back and forth between things on the site.  You can see an example of a navigation bar on <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/weblab/2KO4FIjN89QPeYnTG_NzLIjroaG8daOY3jRl5uHm1Co/" target="_new">this page</a>

        <summary><strong>What is CSS?</strong></summary>

        CSS is a language that controls the way content on a web site appears.  It uses rule-sets to change the look of a page.  Each rule set has a selector, which specifies which elements on the page will be affected, and the rules, which explain how to display the elements.   Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        </pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        </div>

        # Underlining

        -   Find the code in the style sheet that makes the h1 tag underlined.
        -   Change the text decoration and see which one you like.
            -   Choose from "underline", "overline", and "line-through"
        -   Add a text decoration rule for the paragraph or h3 tag.

Each rule consists of a property and a value for that property.

        Here’s an example of a rule-set that makes the text in an `h2` tag blue and cursive:

        <pre>h2 {
           color: blue;
           font-family: cursive;
        }</pre>

        In this example, `h2` is the selector, `color` and `font-family` are properties, and `blue` and `cursive` are the values for those properties.

        Here is the code that is controlling the paragraph text size:

            p {
              font-size: 14px;
            }

        -   `p` is the _selector_.  It specifies which elements will have to follow the rules inside the curly braces. The `p` stands for paragraph.
        -   `font-size: 14px;` is the rule that makes the text inside the `p` tags a particular size.
            -   `font-size` is the _property_.  It explains what the rule is about, in this case the text size.
            -   `14px` is the _value_.  It explains how the rule should be applied, in this case making the text 14 pixels big.

        ::: details [**What does <code>px</code> mean / What is a pixel?**]

        Pixel, which is abbreviated `px`, is how elements are measured in CSS.  It’s the size of a single point of light on the screen.

Next, add your list items **inside** the unordered list tags.  To make each list item, use the list item tags `<li></li>` and write the list item inside the tags.
        <br /><br />
        It can be helpful to indent your \<li> tags so it's clear they are contained in the \<ul> tag.

        list is just a set of bulleted items.\n<br /><br />An unordered list element
        has the tag `<ul>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>U</strong>nordered
        <strong>L</strong>ist. Each item in the list is marked by a list item element
        `<li>`. This is an abbreviation for <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>I</strong>tem.
        \ The list item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside
        of its parent element, the unordered list (`<ul>`).\n\n:::\n\n::: details

        steps: making the list and adding the list items.  To make the unordered list,
        write the unordered list tags `<ul></ul>`.  Next, add your list items **inside**

        You just walked through someone else's plan for creating a game, so now it's time to make it your own. What additional features or challenges do you want to create?

        # Do This

        Select one of the challenges below to add to the game or come up with a challenge of your own.

        -   Change the visuals of the game so that your player, enemies, or cake look different.
        -   End the game when the enemies get to the cake and print the score. For an extra challenge end the game only after 3 enemies get through.

        # Moving Left and Right

        Now that your enemy sprites are moving correctly, it's time to write the code to move your player. For now you'll just need to get your character moving left and right and changing its animations.

        # Do This

        For this level you'll be writing code inside the `movePlayer` function.

        -   Use an `if` block along with `keyDown` to detect when the "right" arrow is pressed.
        -   Use `sprite.x` and the counter pattern increase the player's x position by 3.
        -   Use another `if` block to move the player to the left when the "left" arrow is pressed. This time you'll need to decrease the player's x position.

        Test your game. Your character sprite should now move left and right when you press the left and right arrows.

        So far we've looked at a lot of ways to check if a single condition is true, but often a program needs to check the state of many conditions simultaneously before making a decision. For this challenge, let's assume the following scenario:

        -   The sprite should move up, down, left, and right if the corresponding arrow key is pressed.
        -   The sprite should _not_ go all the way off the screen in any direction.

        # Do This Together

        Before you tackle writing this program, you'll need to figure out how to check multiple conditions at once.

        -   **Brainstorm** with your neighbors ways you might check for more than one condition.
        -   **Share** back with the whole class so you can see other potential approaches.
        -   **Explore** the toolbox for blocks that might help (pay extra attention to the Math and Control drawers).
        -   **Program** your proposed solution.
        -   **Test** your program to make sure it's actually checking all of the conditions you intended.

        Let's use one more Boolean expression to check the condition of a sprite.

        # Do This

        There is a growing apple sprite created for you. It starts as green and should turn red when it gets to a scale of 2. We won't worry about making it red yet, let's just use a `console.log` command to check whether it's scale is 2 yet.

        -   Add a `console.log` statement.

        Use a conditional in the draw loop to check whether `apple.scale` is greater than 2 - if it is, set the apples new animation to "apple\_red".

        # Adding Sprites

        Now that you have the more static elements of your card layed out, it's time to add the Sprites. Your Sprites should provide the primary animations and interactions for your card - so feel free to get creative here and have fun.

        # Do This

        Check out the Sprites table on the back of your planning sheet. For each Sprite in your table:

        -   Initialize the Sprite at the top of your program with `createSprite()`.
        -   Find or create the image(s) for the Sprite and set it with `setAnimation()`.
        -   Inside the `draw()` loop update any Sprite properties that we will be constantly animating (we'll deal with conditionals in a minute).

        # Do This

        On the interactions table from your planning sheet, find all of the interactions that rely on user input (key presses and mouse movements). For each of those interactions:

        -   Add an `if` block (or `if-else` block if you need a fallback action) inside the `draw()` loop.
        -   Add the appropriate input block for your condition (such as `keyDown()` or `mouseDown()`).
        -   Add the necessary actions inside the `if` block.

        **Challenge:** Can you create more sophisticated conditionals by nesting them or using compound booleans?

        So far you've used `keyDown` as a way to let users control your programs, but that's just one of many ways to take input. In fact, just one of many ways _to detect keypresses_! Depending on how you want to react to a keypress, there are a few other blocks you might want to use.

        After making your prediction, run the code and write down or share with your neighbor your observations.

        -   What seems to be the difference between `keyDown()`, `keyWentDown()`, and `keyWentUp()`?

        One of the simplest ways to take input is to just make a sprite follow the user's mouse position. **You can get the x and y location of the mouse using `World.mouseX` and `World.mouseY`.**  This follows the pattern you learned with sprite properties. `World` is the name of the object. `mouseX` and `mouseY` are the names of the properties.

        You are going to make a bee sprite follow the mouse around the game area.

        -   The bee image is already loaded in the animation tab for you.

        When you use the counter pattern for the `rotation` property with addition, the object will always rotate clockwise. Sometimes however you will want your sprite to rotate the other direction. To do this you can just use subtraction!

        # Do This

        There are three gears set up for you. You need to make the gears all look like they are rotating in sync with each other.

        -   Make the gears rotate so they look like they are working as one system.
        -   **Hint: They won't all rotate the same direction**.

        By combining shapes, sprites, and a new block called `text`, you can create simple scenes, stories, or comics. While this example is fairly simple, you can combine as many sprites and shapes as you like to create scenes as complex or detailed as you like.

        ## Sketch It Out

        Before moving on, take a second to sketch out a scene that you'd like to make at the end of this lesson. Consider the simple shapes that you've used in the past, sprites for your characters, and any text that you'd like on the screen. Once you've sketched out an idea, you'll learn about `text` and how to compose a scene.

        By combining shapes, sprites, and text, you can create simple scenes, stories, or comics. While this example is fairly simple, you can combine as many sprites and shapes as you like to create scenes as complex or detailed as you like.

        ## Sketch It Out

        Before moving on, take a second to sketch out a scene that you'd like to make at the end of this lesson. Consider the simple shapes that you've used in the past, sprites for your characters, and any text that you'd like on the screen. Once you've sketched out an idea, you'll learn about `text` and how to compose a scene.

        # Moving to the Left

        If adding to a sprite's x coordinate makes it move to the right, how could you make it move to the left?

        # Do This

        Make your program animate like the image to the right. Update `fly.x` inside the draw loop so that in each frame the fly is drawn a little bit further to the left.

        _Tip: You can make your sprites move faster by adding or subtracting larger numbers. The fly in our example moves about twice as fast as the plane in the last level._

        -   Add an `if` statement inside your draw loop below the one you created for the "up" arrow.
        -   Use the `keyDown` block to make the `if` statement respond to when the "right" arrow is pressed.
        -   Inside the `if` block use the counter pattern with the `sprite.velocityX` block to add 0.1 to the sprite's X velocity.

        Run your code to see how it works. The sprite should start floating to the right when you press the right arrow and jump when you press "up". You'll make the left arrow work in the next level.

        # Bounciness

        So far, `bounceOff` has made sprites bounce away from other objects as fast as they bounced into them.  In the real world, almost everything slows down just a little bit when it bounces off something else.  You can use the `bounciness` block to tell your sprite how much to slow down or speed up when it bounces off something else.

        # Do This

        -   Read the code below and press "Run" to see the behavior of the basketball and pool ball.
        -   Use a `bounciness` block to set the bounciness of your soccer ball.
        -   Run the code again to see how the sprites bounce off the floor.

        Sometimes sprites will behave in ways that are unexpected. There is a special `sprite.debug` property you can use to better understand why the sprites interact the way that they do.

        # Do This

        These two coins are round, so you would expect them to bounce in a certain way. Something weird is happening though!

        -   Run the code and watch the way that the coins interact.
        -   Use the `sprite.debug` block to make debug 'true' for both the sprites and run the code again.

        # Write Your Own Sprite Interaction

        In the last level you should have written code for a sprite interaction that you developed with your classmates. This time try to write the program on your own, but you can use the patterns you saw in the last level.

        # Do This

        The elephant should **push the hippo off the screen**. Notice that the elephant moves at a random Y velocity each time the program runs.

        -   Using the patterns from the last level, write code that makes the elephant push the hippo off the screen.

        When the apple hits the blender, the blender should turn on.

        Use the `isTouching` block to make the blender shake back and forth when the apple sprite touches the blender sprite.  The shaking motion is already coded using the random block, so you just have to check when the two sprites are touching.

        Writing out the math each time you want to check whether two sprites are touching can take a while, so a programmer created the `isTouching` block, which can check whether one sprite is touching another sprite (the _target_).  The computer is still doing the same math as in the previous program, but you don't have to worry about it because another programmer already did that work.

        # Do This

        Inside the draw loop, drag the `isTouching` block into the `if` block.     ( [Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered) )

        -   Run the program and observe the interaction between the two sprites.
        -   Discuss with a neighbor: Using only the commands you already know how could you create this kind of interaction? There are many ways to do it, but here are some blocks to consider:

        # Collision Types

        There are four types of collisions that we use in Game Lab.  These blocks will cause a certain type of interaction between the _sprite_ and its _target_.

        ## displace

        The `displace` block causes the sprite to push the target as long as they are touching each other. The sprite keeps moving normally.

        ## collide

        The `collide` block makes the sprite stop when it runs into the target.  If the target is moving, it will push the sprite with it.  The target keeps moving normally.

        ## bounce

        The `bounce` block makes the sprite and the target bounce when they touch each other.  Both the sprite and the target change how they are moving.

        ## bounceOff

        The `bounceOff` block makes the sprite bounce off the target.  The target keeps moving normally.

        The `collide` block makes the sprite stop when it runs into the target.  If the target is moving, it will push the sprite with it.  The target keeps moving normally.

        ## bounce

        The `bounce` block makes the sprite and the target bounce when they touch each other.  Both the sprite and the target change how they are moving.

        ## bounceOff

        The `bounceOff` block makes the sprite bounce off the target.  The target keeps moving normally.

        # Collision Types

        There are four types of collisions that we use in Game Lab: `displace`, `collide`, `bounce`, and `bounceOff`.  These blocks will cause a certain type of interaction between the _sprite_ and its _target_.

        # Do This

        Choose the best block to model the basketball bouncing off the floor. ( [Show me where](#triggercallout=code_triggered) )

        Here's another example of a platform jumper, but it has a few more features.  You can use it to get ideas to improve your own game.  For example, there is a coin sprite that gives the player an extra life.

        Choose one or more of the following changes and add them to your game.

        -   Choose new animations for your player, platform, and items.
        -   Make it impossible for your player to go off the left or right of the screen.
        -   Add a different type of item for the player to collect or avoid.
        -   Add a variable that keeps track of how many lives the player has, and end the game if the player runs out.

        Choose at least two of the input elements, and for each one:

        -   Drag it out and position it on the screen
        -   Change the id to something meaningful

        The pizza party data has been put into an app for you, and the answers from another class have been added.  Because this is an app, we can automate the creation of the bar chart from the given data.

        # Do This

        -   Click "Run" to see the list of answers that the classes have given.
        -   Discuss with a partner what you think the chart of this data will look like.
        -   Click "Show Chart" to see for yourself.

        # Spreadsheet Version

        The pizza party data has also been put into a spreadsheet for you, if you would like to use it instead.  To use the spreadsheet, you'll need to make your own copy of it.

        -   This link will make you your own copy of the "Pizza Topping Choices" data: [Pizza Topping Choices](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q1vdgmIlGgxiqJs_VnqHvko18UD6XvRXrnY3JSU97NQ/copy)

        # 5-Bit Number

        When you only had four bits, the highest number that you could make was fifteen.  Now you'll have a chance to work with more bits to make higher numbers.

        In this activity, the dots are replaced with numbers, but you still add up everything that's showing to see what number the binary code stands for.  The left-most bit doesn't have a number yet, so you'll have to give it one.

        # Do This

        -   Click on the bits to turn them on and off, and see the different numbers you can make.
        -   With your partner, discuss the pattern in the numbers.  Decide what number you think should go in the left most box.
        -   Click "Edit" to change the value of the left most bit.
        -   Once you've decided on the value, try to make the following numbers: 16, 27, 31

        # Displaying Sensor Readings in Color

        In the earlier prediction level you saw how the `setScale()` method can convert the full range of sensor readings (0-1023) into a range that can be used for RGB values (0-255). Let's build on that idea to make an app that can communicate the current value of all three analog sensors with a single color.

        # Do This

        To start, we just need to set the sensor scales correctly - don't worry about actually setting the color of the background yet.

        -   Using the `sensor.setScale()` block, set each of light and sound sensors to the right scale for an RGB color channel.
        -   Create a variable for each of the three colors and assign each one to the value of a different sensor.
        -   Use `console.log()` to test that your variables are in the correct range.

        _Hint: Order matters. You need to set the scale of a sensor before checking its value_

        _Hint: Remember that the temperature sensor can be read in both Celsius and Fahrenheit - either way it should already give you a value that's within the necessary range for RGB_

        # Change Threshold

        By default a sensor's "change" event fires every time the sensor value changes at all, even by one. The light and sound sensors are constantly fluctuating, so you probably want the "change" event to be a little less responsive. The `threshold` property allows you to set how much a sensor should change before considering it a "change" event - so setting `soundSensor.threshold = 100` would cause the sound sensor's "change" event only to trigger if its value increased or decreased by at least 100.

        # Do This

        This app changes the background color of the screen whenever the sound sensor value changes, but we want to only respond to big changes in volume (like a loud noise). Use the `soundSensor.threshold` block to fix it.

        -   Add a `soundSensor.threshold` block before the event handler
        -   Test out which how different threshold values impact the "change" event
        -   Choose a threshold value that makes the screen background change only when a loud noise is sensed.

        _Tip: Your threshold depends on how much ambient noise there is in the room, and how much it changes. A threshold that works in a quiet room may not work in a louder classroom._

        # Make Your Own Buttons

        Similar to LEDs, buttons are a really simple circuit that you can add to your board pretty easily. Like LEDs, buttons should be wired from a numbered pin to a ground pin, but unlike LEDs, a button circuit should be disconnected in the middle. When you connect the circuit, it will produce a button press event.

        # Do This

        -   Grab two wires.
        -   Connect one wire to an open numbered pin.
        -   Connect the second wire to a ground pin.
        -   Update line 2 so that it's referencing the pin you chose.
        -   Run the provided code.
        -   With the program running, touch the unconnected ends of both wires together to "press" the button.

        _Tip: A button circuit can be made with many different kinds of materials, as long as they are electrically conductive. Try making buttons with foil, silverware, or paper clips._

        You might have noticed that the new blocks we're using are in a different toolbox drawer. The **Circuit** drawer contains all of the board objects that are built into the Circuit Playground, but when you start wiring your own circuits the Maker Toolkit no longer knows where everything is.

In addition to the `pinMode()` and `digitalWrite()` commands you've seen, it includes commands to create new objects on the board that can be programmed in the same way as the blocks in the **Circuit** drawer. The `var myLed = createLed()` command, for example, creates a new LED object that behaves just like the `led` blocks you've been using.

        -   Replace the variable label `myLed` with a unique label.
        -   Make sure you're in text mode, not block mode.
        -   Add an `led.blink()` command.
        -   Replace the text `led` with your new LED variable.
        -   Test your code.

        # Wire a Circuit

        You can use any of the numbered pads to add additional circuits to your board. Let's use pin 2 to add another LED.

        # Do This

        -   Using a wire, connect pin 2 to the positive (+) side of an LED
        -   Using another wire, connect the negative (-) side of the LED to a ground (GND) pin (it doesn't matter which one)
        -   Run this program to test your circuit. If it worked, your LED should turn on.

        We could write a for loop for each different color that we want to set LEDs to, but that would be a lot of duplicate code that's _almost_ the same. This is the perfect place to use a _function with a parameter_! You've seen and used functions with parameters before, but now you're going to make one from scratch.

        # Do This

        Create a function called `setLedsColor` that takes a parameter `color` and uses it to change the color of all of the LEDs

        -   At the bottom of your program, drag out a function with parameter block ![expandable](https://images.code.org/bd6ec3d9a651cf760a7dc8e1949658c0-image-1512761901850.png)

        -   Change the parameter name from `n` to `color`
        -   Inside your function, add a _for loop_ that repeats until it reaches the end of `colorLeds`
        -   Inside your _for loop_, set the color of the current led to the parameter `color` (eg. `colorLeds[i].color(color)`

        We'll add event handlers that use this function in the next level, but for now you can test your function by your program and typing this into the debug console: `setLedsColor("blue")`

        # Calling Your Function

        Now that you've created a function that can behave differently based on the parameter it is passed, we can use it in multiple different event handlers to change the lights to different colors.

        # Do This

        We'll start simple by just creating an event handler for "button\_red"

        -   Create a new event handler to respond to "button\_red"
        -   Inside your event handler, add a "call function with parameter" block

        # Calling Your Function

        Now that you've created a function that can behave differently based on the parameter it is passed, we can use it in multiple different event handlers to change the lights to different colors.

        # Do This

        We'll start simple by just creating an event handler for "button\_red"

        -   Create a new event handler to respond to "button\_red"
        -   Inside your event handler, add a "call function with parameter" block

        -   Create a new event handler
        -   Call your `setLedsColor` function with the appropriate color ("green", "blue", or "white")
        -   Test your program to make sure all of the buttons work

        # Switching Colors with a Function

        We could write a for loop for each different color that we want to set LEDs to, but that would be a lot of duplicate code that's _almost_ the same. This is the perfect place to use a _function with a parameter_! You've seen and used functions with parameters before, but now you're going to make one from scratch.

        # Do This

        Create a function called `setLedsColor` that takes a parameter `color` and uses it to change the color of all of the LEDs

        -   At the bottom of your program, drag out a function with parameter block ![expandable](https://images.code.org/bd6ec3d9a651cf760a7dc8e1949658c0-image-1512761901850.png)
        -   Change the name from `myFunction` to `setLedsColor`
        -   Change the parameter name from `n` to `color`
        -   Inside your function, add a _for loop_ that repeats until it reaches the end of `colorLeds`
        -   Inside your _for loop_, set the color of the current led to the parameter `color` (eg. `colorLeds[i].color(color)`

        We'll add event handlers that use this function in the next level, but for now you can test your function by your program and typing this into the debug console: `setLedsColor("blue")`

        -   The programmer forgot how to use the counter pattern to increase the movement variable.

        These parameters show up as a variable that can be used inside the function, and you can create functions that use parameters too!

        These parameters show up as a variable that can be used inside the function, and you can create functions that use parameters too!

        Instead of a separate function to move the red and the blue players, we've created one function called `movePlayer()` that takes the ID of the player image as a parameter called `player`. Inside this function, you can use `player` any place where you need to specify the ID of the player you want to control.

        -   Find where `movePlayer()` is defined ( [Show me where](#triggercallout=block_trigger) )
        -   Inside the `movePlayer()` definition:
            -   Get the current "y" property of the player and save it to a variable called `player_y`
            -   Increase the value of `player_y` by 10
            -   Set the "y" property of player to your new value `player_y`

        Once you've added your code, test it. You should see that _both buttons_ work even though we only created one function - cool!

        # The checkWin() Function

        The last function that you need to figure out is the `checkWin()` function, which after each player is moved, and is used to both check if that player has made it to the bottom of the screen and to announce the winner if necessary. For now, we're just going to find out where the player is and log it to the console.

        # Do This

        Just like the `movePlayer()` function, `checkWin()` takes a single parameter called `player`. If you call `checkWin("red")`, then the variable `player` will have the value "red".

        -   Find where the function is defined ( [Show me where](#triggercallout=block_trigger) )
        -   Create a variable called `player_y` and assign it the "y" property of the player
        -   Use either a `console.log()` command or a watcher to report the value of `player_y`
        -   Play the game with only one button, keeping an eye on the value of `player_y`

        # Activate Your Button

        In the last lesson you focused on laying out a page of your app in Design Mode. This is a great, quick way to get the visual side of an app figured out, but it's not very functional. If you click any of the buttons you added, nothing happens. Now you're work towards adding some basic functionality by making the buttons in your app actually _do_ something!

        **Goal:** Add code using Design Mode to make the button respond to a click.

        # Do This

        Your starter app has two elements, a _label_ with the id `titleLabel` and a _button_ with the id `changeTitleButton`. To start with, you're going to make the button log a message to the console when it's clicked.

        -   In Design Mode, **click on the provided button to edit its properties**
        -   Click on the **Events** tab
        -   Insert an `onEvent` from Design Mode by clicking **Insert and show code** under the **Events Tab**.
        -   Take a look at the block that was added to the **Code Mode** tab.
        -   Run the program, click your button and **look for the output in the _Debug Console_** below the workspace instead of the app window. We will discuss the _Debug Console_ on the next level.

        # Updating IDs and Debugging with Console Log

        Here we have a couple buttons with event handlers and `console.log` statements, but they are all switched around!

        We should have given the buttons better ID names so we could tell the difference based on the ID. **Can you update the ID names and `console.log` messages to match the correct button?**

        # Do This

        -   **Change the IDs** of the buttons in Design Mode to more descriptive names.

        -   Switch to Code Mode and notice that the **ID pulldowns have been updated to include the new IDs**. (You still need to select the correct ID from the pulldown menu.)

        -   **Update the `console.log` messages** to match the buttons.

        # Switching Screens

        # How Do Events Work?

        Event-driven apps are made up of elements that can trigger events (such as buttons) and pieces of code called **event handlers**. Event handlers are commands that "watch" for certain events to occur in your program, and then run some function when an event occurs.

        When you first create an event handler from Design Mode, puts a `console.log()` block inside to help you test the event, but you can put just about any code you want inside the event hander.

        # Do This

        The toolbox has a new block called `setText` which allows you to change the text of an element on the screen. You're going to modify the button event handler so that it changes the title text when clicked.

        -   Drag out a `setText()` block to the _inside_ of the `onEvent()` callback function (where the `console.log()` block currently is)
        -   From the block's dropdown, select "titleLabel" (the id of the element you want to change)
        -   In the block's second input, replace "text" with a new title for the app
        -   Run your program and click the button to see it work
      CSDU4 - Design Mode - 4: |-
        # IDs

        The `id` (we'll typically write **ID**) is a **unique identifier** used for each element in the app.

        Each element that appears in the app must have a **unique ID**. In fact, if you try to run a program that has two buttons with same ID you will get a warning message in the console.

        # Do This

        While each element you drag out in Design Mode gets a default ID, they aren't really that helpful (like `button1` and `button2`), so you should get in the habit of creating your own IDs.

        -   Change the ID of your "click me" button to something useful (like `redButton`)
        -   Drag out a second button

        # Icons

        Icons help users find the right functionality while also making your app feel more polished.

        # Do This

        Add a few icons to your app. For each icon:

        -   Drag out an image element
        -   Next to the "Picture" field click "Choose..."
        -   Click on the "Icons" tab and select one
        -   Make sure to give your image a good ID! (do we still need to say it?)
      CSDU4 Connecting Screens: |-
        # Navigating

        Once you start adding multiple screens to an app, you need to make sure that users can always get where they want to go. In the next two levels you'll learn how to make sure a user can always get back to the "homepage" of your app.

        # Do This

        Here's an app with four different pages, but only the "red" screen is linked so far. In this level you'll make the other two buttons take the user to the correct screen.

        -   Add two `onEvent()` blocks, one each for the "greenButton" and "blueButton"
        -   Use the `setScreen()` block to make each button switch to the appropriate screen
        -   Test your app to make sure both buttons work. For example, when you click the green button you should go to the green screen.
      CSDU4 Connecting Screens Getting Back: |-
        # Navigating Back

        Someone using your app can now get to each of the red, green, and blue pages, but they can't get back to the homepage. You can add buttons and event handlers of your own to help them do this.

        # Do This

        Create buttons and event handlers to help a user navigate back to the "home" screen

        -   Use Design Mode to create a button inside each of the "red", "green", and "blue" screens. Make sure to give them descriptive IDs.
        -   Back in your code drag in three `onEvent()` blocks, one for each of the three buttons you made.
        -   Inside each `onEvent()` block use the `setScreen()` block that switches back to your "home" screen.
        -   Test your app. You should now be able to navigate back to the home screen from each of the other three.
      CSDU4 Crowdsource App Demo: |-
        # Crowdsourcing

        Crowdsourcing apps allow multiple users to submit content for everyone to use (the _source_ of content is the _crowd_). This app is very similar to the list app, with the main difference being that the list app assumes a single user while this app allows all users to add to the same list and "like" submissions.

        This example uses a list of crowdsourced information for simplicity, but you could display any kind of information in many different formats. A crowdsourcing app could allow users to submit locations for display on a map, images to go into a gallery, or any number of other types of information.

      CSDU4 Decision App Demo: |-
        # Decision Maker

        Similar to the quiz app, a decision tree app asks the user a series of questions. The primary difference between the two is that a decision tree doesn't check for right or wrong answers, but instead attempts to give the user a suggestion or help them make a decision based on their answers.

        This simple decision maker asks only three questions,  but more advanced ones actually take the form of a tree as seen below:

        ![](https://images.code.org/aeadfca116011949855c169905ff89a3-image-1476823699500.png)

        Depending on the user's answer to each question, they're given a different page for the next question. This allows the app to gradually narrow down the decision one question at a time. This type of app can be really useful to help users understand complex processes - for example, you might introduce a recycling program by using a decision tree app to help users figure out which bin to sort items into - first asking what material it's made out of, then whether it is clean or not, and so on.

        # Functionality Missing from this Prototype

        ## Questions to Consider

        -   Where in App Lab can you design the user interface of your app?
        -   What are some types of elements that you can add to your app?
      CSDU4 Functionality visible: |-
        # Controlling Visibility

        Earlier in this lesson, when we were proposing ways to simplify the quiz app, we mentioned that it was possible to show or hide design elements with code. App Lab has two functions that let you control the visibility of an element:

        -   `hideElement()` makes the specified element invisible
        -   `showElement()` makes the specified element visible

        # Do This

        The provided app has an image and two buttons.

        -   Attach an event handler to the "Hide" button that hides the image when clicked
        -   Attach an event handler to the "Show" button that shows the image when clicked

        While this example focuses on a single list, more sophisticated list apps could allow the user to create multiple lists, or even move items between lists. This app also only keeps track of the name of an item and whether or not it is "Done," but it could be extended to track and organize any amount of information about the list items.

        -   Add a comment to the top of your program describing the feature or bug fix you are implementing
        -   Work on your iteration until it works. Try to stay focused on only the single feature or bug that you've selected.

        With all of your screens in place you can start adding events that will change the screens. When you're done with this step you'll actually have an interactive prototype!

        # Do This

        For each screen of your app:

        -   Find all of the button IDs
        -   For each button, add an event handler that watches that ID
        -   In each event handler, use `setScreen()` to move the the right screen
        -   Test it all out!

        Depending on the number of screens and buttons your app has, this can be a pretty involved process. Make sure that you test your work often, using `console.log()` blocks to debug any strange behavior with your app. When you think you've got the whole thing working, compare your app with other members of your group to see if they work the same.

        # setText and getText

        Often you will want to get the text of a UI Element and use it to set the text of another element on the screen. Can you get the text from the dropdown when the user picks a new input and use it to set the text of the "choiceDisplay" label.
      CSDU6 - UI and Inputs - get set with text input: |-
        # setText and getText

        You've seen how to use getText and setText already. Can you make this app get the text the user typed once they hit enter and show it in the text area at the bottom?

        _Tip: The "change" event is triggered when the user clicks "enter" in a field. Use an event handler for the text input watching for the "change" event._
      CSDU6 - UI and Inputs - getNumber: |-
        # getNumber

        **Starter Code:** This program creates a simple calculator but **there is something wrong with it. Try putting in 2 + 2.**

        We can fix this by using `getNumber()` instead of `getText()`. Can you fix the program by changing `getText()` to `getNumber()`?
      CSDU6 - UI and Inputs - getNumber practice: |-
        # getNumber

        **Starter Code:** The program tries to update the valueDisplay whenever the slider value changes but it always sets the value to 10.

        Can you use `getNumber()` to get the value of the slider and update the valueDisplay as it changes?
      CSDU6 - UI and Inputs - getText: |-
        # getText

        Try to set up an event handler that gets the text from the dropdown whenever a user selects a new item from the dropdown. You will need to use the getter `getText()`. Whenever you use a getter you should save it in a variable. Use `console.log()` to make sure it is working.

        # Hide and Show

        It is a little weird that both buttons are on the screen at the same time. You don't need the stop alarm button until the alarm is on. Can you make the buttons only show when they are needed?

        -   You will want the stop alarm button to be hidden when the program starts. You can do this in design mode.

        Hint: When you click the trigger alarm button, you should change the text, hide the trigger alarm button, _and_ show the stop alarm button.

        # Buzzer Duration

        As you've noticed, `buzzer.frequency()` has two parameters: frequency and duration. Both of these take a number as input.

        -   Frequency changes how the buzzer sounds. The bigger the number you give it, the higher the buzzer's sound will be.

        -   Duration determines how long the buzzer is going to play a sound for in milliseconds.

        For right now we're going to focus on duration, the second parameter.

        # Do this

        Try out a few things with duration:

        -   Change the duration of the buzzer to something longer than 100.

        # Challenge: 2D Arrays

        Arrays can hold all sorts of data, like numbers, strings, and even other arrays. When we put an array inside another, this becomes a 2D array. The `buzzer.playSong()` block can be used to play songs that sound more precise with 2D arrays.

        The structure that you've been using to play notes looks like this:

        `buzzer.playNotes( [array of notes to play] , tempo of the whole song);`

        The main difference with `buzzer.playSong()` is each element inside the `[array of notes to play]`, is an array with two elements: the note you want to play, and the duration of the note. Sometime you'll want a quarter note in your song, other times you'll want a full note, or maybe somewhere in between. A full song might look something like this:

        `buzzer.playSong([
          ["G3",0.25],
          ["C4",0.25],
          ["E4",0.25],

        # Null Notes

        You may have noticed that if you put the same note side-by-side in the array, the buzzer just plays that note as one long sound instead of as individual notes. In music we often want a break (or _rest_) between notes. You can get your buzzer to play a rest by sending it the value `null`.

        `null` is a special value that represents emptiness in computer science. `playNotes` plays each note for the same duration, so a `null` element in the array is just telling `playNotes` to play nothing for the same duration as everything else.

        # Break a random substitution cipher!

        Messages encrypted with the **Caesar cipher** are very easy to crack. What if instead of shifting the whole alphabet, we mapped every letter of the alphabet to a random different letter of the alphabet? This is called a **random substitution cipher**.

        In this version of the tool, you'll be interacting more with the graphs that show letter frequency. By analyzing the frequency of the letters in the encrypted input message compared to the frequency of letters in a typical piece of English prose, you can start to narrow in on what some of the letter mappings might be. Did you know that _'E'_ is the most common letter used in the English language? Maybe the most common letter in your encrypted text maps to the letter _'E'_, but maybe not! You'll have to do a bit of guess and check to see if that substitution makes sense.

        # Do this

        -   Load the **Sample message (hard)** from the message dropdown. This will load a message that has been encrypted with a random substitution cipher.\

        -   You will crack the message by guessing what each letter of the alphabet contained in the original ciphertext should be changed to. You can do so by dragging the blue letters of the alphabet directly underneath the orange letter you want changed in the original ciphertext. Letters that have been changed using your guesses will no longer be highlighted orange in the message window on the left.

        -   Play with some of the sorting options available in the Random substitution cipher tab to get different views on the letter frequencies in the input text as well as standard English text.

      Gamelab StartScreen Change State: |-
        # Changing the State

        Now that you can display a different screen according to the state of your program, you will need a way to change between states.  To go from the "starting" state to the "playing" state, you can have the user press the "s" key.  You'll **only** want the program to check for the key press when the program is in the "starting" state, so your code for this will go inside the "starting" conditional.  Putting one `if` block inside another is called **nesting** conditionals.

        ## Do this

        -   Inside the `if` statement that checks for "starting", add in a new `if` statement that checks whether the user has pressed the "s" key.  (`if (keyDown("s")) {`)
        -   Inside your new `if` statement, set the value of your `gameState` variable to "playing". (`gameState = "playing";`)
        -   Test the code by starting the game and pressing "s".  The game should start playing after the key is pressed.

        If the game isn't starting on the start screen, double check that when the `gameState` variable is created at the beginning of the program, its value is "starting".  (`var gameState = "starting";`)
      Gamelab StartScreen Check State: |-
        # Checking Game State

        Now that you have your game state stored in a variable, you can check it to determine what should be displayed.  This should happen inside the draw loop, since it's something that will change as the program is being run.  The program should check whether the game is in the "playing" state, and only run the program if it is.  We can worry about the other states later.

        ## Do This

        -   Inside the draw loop, add a conditional (`if` statement).
        -   For the condition, check if `gameState == "playing"`.
        -   Move the rest of the code from the draw loop inside the `if` statement, so it only runs if the game is "playing".
        -   Run the program.  Nothing should happen because the game is still in the "starting" state.
        -   Go back to where you set the value of your `gameState` variable and change it from "starting" to "playing".
        -   Run the game again, and it should play normally, because it is now in the "playing" state.
        -   Change the value of the variable back to "starting".

        (It is important to find ways to check your code as you go, rather than wait until the end of many complex changes to run it.  By checking both the playing and starting states, you know that your conditional is working properly and that the game should play while in the "playing" state.)
      Gamelab StartScreen Check States: |-
        # Check all States

        Right now the only state your program can deal with is "playing", but you can add more conditionals to account for the other three states.

        ## Do this

        -   Inside the draw loop, add in three more `if` statements that check for `gameState == "starting"`, `gameState == "won"`, and `gameState == "lost"`, respectively.
        -   Inside each `if` statement, add code that will draw text to the screen, so you can see the results of the different states.  You may also want to use `drawSprites` so you can see the background image and the player sprites, but make sure you are drawing the text on top of the sprites.
        -   Check your code by running the program in the different states.  (Don't worry about making them perfect yet, just make sure that the conditionals are working as they should.)

        In order to keep track of your code, you might find it useful to create a function for each of the different text displays, then call those functions inside the conditionals.
      Gamelab StartScreen End Game: |-
        # Ending the Game

        Next, you'll need to add code that changes the state of the game when you lose.   Scroll down to the bottom of the program, to the `gameStatus` function.  Inside the function, the program checks the score and lives variables to check whether the use should win or lose the game.  Instead of displaying a win or lose message, you'll want to change the state of the game to "won" or "lost";

        ## Do this

        -   Inside the `gameStatus` function, replace the code `text("You Won!", 35, 200);` with `gameState = "won"`.
        -   Inside the `gameStatus` function, replace the code `text("You Lost!", 35, 200);` with `gameState = "lost"`.
        -   Check your code by running the game and losing.
        -   Check your code by running the game and winning.

        (To make the game much easier to win, change the original number of lives to 1000 by replacing `var lives = 3;` to `var lives = 1000;`.)
      Gamelab StartScreen Hide Sprites: |-
        # Hide and Show Sprites

        You may prefer that the platform, coin, and rock sprites only be visible when the game is playing.  You can change the game setup to set their visible property to `false` at the beginning of the game, then set it to `true` when you start the game, then `false` again when the game is won or lost.

        ## Do this

        -   Add code after you create your platforms, gold, and rocks sprite groups that sets those sprite groups' visible properties to `false` (e.g. `platforms.setVisibileEach(false);` )
        -   In the same  three places where you set `gameState = "playing";`, set the sprite groups' visible properties to `true`.
        -   In the same places where you set `gameState = "lost";` and `gameState = "won";`, set the sprite groups' visible
        -   Check your code by running the game and losing and restarting the game.
        -   Check your code by running the game and winning and restarting the game.
      Gamelab StartScreen Intro: |-
        # Start and End Screens

        This tutorial will teach you how to make start and end screens in Game Lab, as well as restart the game from the end screen.

        Hit run to play the game on the left.  Follow the instructions on the start screen to play.  Once the game is over, follow the instructions on the end screen to restart the game.

        In the next bubble, you'll see the code for game play and start to add your own start and end screens.

        ## Start Screen

        The start screen is the introductory screen that appears before the user starts playing the game.  It usually has the title of the game and some basic instructions for playing.  It might also include the game developer.

        ## End Screen

        The end screen appears after the user has won or lost the game.  It sometimes includes the final score, player rankings or other information.  It can also have an option to play the game again.
      Gamelab StartScreen Restart Game: |-
        # Restarting the Game

        Last, you'll need to add code that restarts the game.   This is similar to how you started the game by having the user press the "s" key.  This time, you'll need to check during the "lost" and "won" states.  If the user presses the "r" key during on of these states, you should restart the game by setting the `gameState` to "playing" and also resetting the `score` and `lives` variables to 0 and 3, respectively.

        ## Do this

        -   Inside the `if (gameState == "lost") {` statement, add an if statement that checks whether the user has pressed the "r" key.
        -   Inside your new `if` statement, set `score` to 0, `lives` to 3, and `gameState` to "playing".
        -   Inside the `if (gameState == "won") {` statement, add an if statement that checks whether the user has pressed the "r" key.
        -   Inside your new `if` statement, set `score` to 0, `lives` to 3, and `gameState` to "playing".
        -   Inside the `gameStatus` function, replace the code `text("You Lost!", 35, 200);` with `gameState = "lost"`.
        -   Check your code by running the game and losing and restarting the game.
        -   Check your code by running the game and winning and restarting the game.
      Gamelab StartScreen State: |-
        # Game State Variable

        Our sample game had four different scenarios (or **states**) that we need to keep track of in order to display the right screen: "starting", "playing", "won", and "lost".  The first step in adding a start or end screen to the game is creating a variable to keep track of any changes in the state of the game.

        ## Do This

        -   Declare a variable called `gameState` at the beginning of the program.  (A good place to do this would be near where `score` and `lives` are declared.
        -   Set the initial value of  your `gameState` variable to "starting"

        (Because you are not using this variable yet, you will see a warning triangle next to the line where it is declared.  It also will not affect how the program runs.)
      Gamelab StartScreen base code: |-
        # Game Code

        This is the code for the game without the start and end screens.  The function `gameStatus` (called on line 43 and defined on line 208) checks whether the user has won or lost, but it only adds a text message to the screen.  Gameplay also continues even after the game is over.

        ## Do This

        Read the code, in particular the code before the draw loop (lines 1-24), inside the draw loop (lines 27-43), and inside the `gameStatus` function (lines 209-224).  It's okay if you don't understand everything in the game, but you should see that the code before the draw loop sets up the sprites, and the code inside the draw loop controls the gameplay.

      OPD-K5 EventsVid: |-
        Watch this video that defines "events" and shows how they work in CS Fundamentals. Afterwards, you will try some puzzles that require you to code events.

        > An event is a line of code that tells your computer to "listen" for something to happen, then take an action. For example, on web pages, you often can display a drop down menu when you roll over the navigation bar with your mouse. The "mouse rollover" is an "event" that triggers an action.

        # Best Practices > Meta-Cognitive Problem Solving

        Explicitly teaching meta-cognitive problem solving strategies before, during and after coding is extremely important in helping students process their learning. Mega-cognitive problem solving involves thinking about your thought process itself, and reflecting on _how_ you solve problems. Watch the video below to learn about Code.org's "Puzzle Solving Recipe" that can help students have success with difficult problems:

        [This worksheet](http://code.org/curriculum/docs/k-5/PuzzleSolvingStudent.png) details the different steps of the Puzzle Solving Recipe.

        ## Looking Ahead > Getting "Unplugged"

        In teaching computer science, you might think it would be best to have access to top tier technology -- new computers, fast Internet, the latest apps. But at Code.org, we've found that some of the most impactful computer science lessons are actually "unplugged," or conducted with little to no technology at all. In these lessons, students learn computer concepts without a computer.

        That's why all of our CS Fundamentals courses use unplugged activities to introduce computer science concepts with physical manipulatives before students write computer programs using those concepts. An example of this would be doing a dance of repeated movements with the class to understand the concept of how loops repeat commands in a computer program. This way when the students go on to writing programs using loops, the unplugged activity has set them up with something they are already familiar with and they can relate this new concept back to that activity.

        Watch the video below to understand the benefits of using unplugged activities to teach computer science.

        **As you work your way through Stages 4-8**, you'll have a chance to review some of our unplugged activities for each of the core concepts covered in this course.

        # Move Picture

        Now make it so the user can find the secret code by clicking the picture. When they click the picture it should move up and out of the way.

        # Do This

        -   Pull out an `onEvent` block
        -   Change the id spot in the `onEvent` block to picture (which is the ID of the picture element)
        -   Inside the `onEvent` block add the `setPosition` block with the following inputs
            -   ID: picture
            -   The next two inputs are x and y values - test out some numbers to try to get the picture to move like in the pictures on the right
      Room Escape Workshop - 4: "# Setting Up the Safe\n\nYou have generated a secret
        code and made it so users can navigate to the second room. Lets give the user
        the ability to enter the secret code when they click on the safe\n\n# Do This\n\n-

      Room Escape Workshop - 5: "# Checking the Secret Code\n\nNow that you have collected
        a guess of the secret code from the user you will need to check if it is correct!
        We can do this using an `if` statement. An if statement checks if a condition
        is true, in this case it will check if the number the user entered is equal
        to the secret code\n\n# Do This\n\n-   Inside the `onEvent` block for the
        safe below the prompt command add an <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5e9a434b1ad6b8f010db928b668127a5-image-1491061131564.37.01

      Standalone_Artist_2: Draw this diamond with 120 and 60 degree angles and 150
        pixel long sides.
      Standalone_Artist_3: Can you draw this hexagon with 100 pixel sides and 60 degree
        turns?
      Standalone_Artist_4: Now you've got a new block to play with, the loop. This
        will repeat a set of commands. What happens if you loop these commands 6 times?
      Standalone_Artist_5: How many times do you need to loop this diamond to draw
        the flower?
      Standalone_Artist_5.5: 'Notice how we simplified the diamond code by turning
        it into a loop. You can loop that whole sequence 12 times to draw the flower.
        Hint: You''ll need to turn 30 degrees after your diamond loop so you don''t
        keep drawing over the same diamond.'
      Standalone_Artist_6: 'Loop this hexagon code 6 times to create the design. How
        many degrees will you need to turn each time? Hint: divide the number of degrees
        in a circle by the number of times you are looping.'
      Standalone_Artist_7: 'A function is another programming tool to help you avoid
        repeating yourself. This function draws a flower, so you can use it any time
        you want to draw a flower. Use this and the new jump block to draw these flowers.
        Hint: The flowers are 150 pixels apart'
      Standalone_Artist_8: Here's a function called `Draw a shape` that we've programmed
        to draw hexagons. Run the code to see what it does and then experiment with
        the function to see what happens. Can you make it draw a pattern of squares,
        triangles, or octagons?
      Standalone_Artist_9: Now go ahead and make whatever picture you'd like! You've
        even got some new blocks and an empty function that you can make do whatever

        # Adding buttons

        Buttons allow your user to interact with your app. This prototype screen will need three buttons (each shaded gray on the prototype.) We've already added the Search button, so you just need to add Contact and About.

        # Do This

        -   **Drag out a new "button" element** for each of the two remaining buttons.
        -   **Change the ids** to match the prototype.
        -   **Change the text** to match the prototype.
        -   **Modify other properties** to make the screen look like you'd like.

        # Making a Search Box

        The search box in our prototype can be created using a "Text Input" element. This is a box that your user can type into, and later your software can read what was entered and do something with it.

        # Do This

        -   **Add a Text Input** element.
        -   **Change the id** to match the prototype.

        The `setScreen` block will change your app to whichever screen you specify. If you place a `setScreen` block _inside_ an `onEvent` block, you can program your buttons to change to the correct screen.

        # Do This

        Using the `onEvent` block that you've created, make your program change to the "search" screen when the `home_search_btn` is clicked.

        -   **Drag out a `setScreen` block** an put it inside the `onEvent` block.
        -   **Select "search"** from the `setScreen` dropdown.
        -   **Run your app** and test the `home_search_btn` button.

        Now that you've made one button work, just follow the same pattern for all of your others.

        # Do This

        -   **Add an `onEvent` block** for each button.
        -   **Select the button ID** from the "id" dropdown.
        -   **Add a `setScreen` block** inside each `onEvent` block.
        -   **Select the screen ID** from each `setScreen` dropdown.
