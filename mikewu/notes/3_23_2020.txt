Things i have learned:

    - hints are stored in a redux state that is populated ONCE on loading. Hints are manually specified by the level creator. 
        - redux : https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/staging/apps/src/redux/authoredHints.js
        - loading initial hints : https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/21c724e6f7c65b08ee8d82347a9beb882eb26252/apps/src/StudioApp.js#L336-L341
        - dispatching to redux : https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/21c724e6f7c65b08ee8d82347a9beb882eb26252/apps/src/authoredHints.js#L102
        - example config by levelbuilder : https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/188131c69a07663a6656671ea767be9b0c642533/dashboard/config/scripts/levels/2-3%20Artist%201%20new.level#L37
    - code blocks are rendered by blockly
        - separate code base https://github.com/code-dot-org/blockly
        - can interact with Blockly using JS console
        - can interact with Blockly from Javascript
            - example : https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/188131c69a07663a6656671ea767be9b0c642533/apps/src/StudioApp.js#L439

    - where is the callback when user clicks run?
        - for Artist : https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/65fec2f9c2e4d65c570d9d4c6e2ef7fa432520d6/apps/src/turtle/artist.js#L868-L869

    - to see changes in the local codeorg instance
        - if JS changes, run `yarn build` or `yarn start` in apps/ and leave running
        - """I usually just keep dashboard-server running in one terminal and yarn start running in another, and never have to restart anything"""
