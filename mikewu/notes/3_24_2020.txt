Global variables: appOptions which contains metadata like level and user id.

How should we implement the highlighting button?

Actual highlighting seems easy: 
    - https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/a3a80ed4764b179222a2d1041a5012566f74e311/apps/src/maze/maze.js#L796
    - StudioApp contains the code https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/blob/fc3d2a361e19b84eb375f97f3ec6b888e1455610/apps/src/StudioApp.js

Question:
    - Advice on implementing the code highlighting
        
        Answer: find relevant code (showPaths thing)?
    
    - Why does enqueue directly show and not hit lightbulb
        
        Answer: try contextual?
    
    - blocklyToCode replacement? I choose the repeat block this way...
        - get block type, args, id
        
        Answer: can convert to XML (which contains everything)
                Blockly.Xml.blockSpaceToDom(Blockly.mainBlockSpace)
                Blockly.Xml.domToPrettyText(Blockly.Xml.blockSpaceToDom(Blockly.mainBlockSpace))
